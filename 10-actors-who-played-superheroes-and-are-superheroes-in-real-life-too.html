As if that weren’t difficult enough, some have to snap into character as superheroes at a moment’s notice. The magic of Hollywood makes this easier on the actors tasked with portraying people with superpowers, but some of them manage to carry over some of their superpowers to real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest Grossing Superhero Movies (That Aren’t Part Of The MCU)</a></span></p><p>These actors set such a great example through their philanthropy efforts that they have earned the title of superhero in real life too. Here we look at ten actors who show us how to be real life superheroes.</p><h2 id=chris-evans>Chris Evans</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Evans</a> truly makes a perfect fit as Captain America. He is one of those people that others struggle to find negative things to say about him, even ex-girlfriends! It should come as no surprise that the actor is an activist in real life, publicly supporting campaigns aimed at animal rights, LGBTQ+ rights, as well as some political activism.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign 'A Starting Point</a>' aims to make political issues accessible, breaking down both sides of major issues in an understandable way, and serve as a starting point for more educated political conversations. He also brings out the shield to visit children in hospitals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christian-bale>Christian Bale</h2><p>Christian Bale may make for a dark and broody Batman, but in real life, Christian Bale has a heart of gold. He is known for supporting a variety of causes, including those considering animals and the environment. However, his truly heroic moment was his reaction to the unfortunate theater shooting that occurred in Colorado during a midnight showing of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dark Knight Rises</a>.</p><p>He went to visit not only each shooting victim, but each emergency worker, doctor, and nurse who helped save lives. He took the time to meet with each person and express his gratitude, a truly heroic gesture.</p><h2 id=paul-rudd>Paul Rudd</h2><p>Paul Rudd does a fabulous job of portraying the Ant-Man in superhero film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Ant-Man</i></a>. And for many children afflicted with cancer and their families, he is a real-life superhero. His personal charity event “Big Slick Celebrity Weekend” began as a simple poker game fundraiser years ago, but has spiraled into a full-blown community affair for doctors, patients, and their families at Children’s Mercy Hospital of Kansas City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Expensive Purchases Made By Paul Rudd</a></span></p><p>What’s especially super about his story is that he began his work long before he portrayed a superhero. He even admits its nice that the kids recognize him now!</p><h2 id=hugh-jackman>Hugh Jackman</h2><p>He may not have razor-sharp claws like his superhero alter-ego <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolverine</a>, but <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> certainly plays the part of a superhero in real life as well as on-screen. He cares about a really wide range of causes and contributes to at least 28 charities regularly.</p><p>However, his primary focus is to fight what he believes is the root cause of many of society’s problems: poverty. Jackman has worked with multiple fundraising organizations to help raise billions of dollars to fight extreme poverty and is always looking for opportunities to connect with others looking to make a positive change in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-reynolds>Ryan Reynolds</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds</a> is never shy about promoting a cause or a charity that is near and dear to his heart. He has publicly supported several charities over the years, including making partnerships with the Make A Wish Foundation.</p><p>However, he and his wife actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively</a> have decided to take a bit more of a political stance with their philanthropic efforts. They recently donated $2 million to support efforts to help migrant children who have been separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. The funding goes towards the surmounting legal costs involved in fighting for their rights.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr>Robert Downey, Jr.</h2><p>When you get the opportunity to play a tech mogul with a lot of disposable income, it’s usually a once-in-a-lifetime chance. But for Robert Downey Jr., Hollywood fantasy is becoming a reality. The “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Man</a>” actor may play a superhero based on technology, but his latest philanthropy project would totally get Tony Stark’s seal of approval.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Robert Downey Jr. Bought</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He will soon launch a collective whose aim is to use robotics to combat pollution in the environment using concepts such as artificial intelligence. While very few details are currently available about the project and how it will begin its mission, it’s said to fully launch by April 2020.</p><h2 id=mark-ruffalo>Mark Ruffalo</h2><p>The actor who plays The Incredible Hulk is going green, and not just in character! <a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a> has been making a truly heroic effort in the area of clean energy and environmental issues, including water pollution and cleaner power sources.</p><p>His philanthropy effort <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Solutions Project</a> is a collaboration of business tycoons, community leaders, and industry professionals all working together to reduce the global carbon footprint while also supporting female and minority leadership roles. The project began by toying around with the idea that they could figure out how to run New York State on one hundred percent renewable energy, and the conversation spiraled from there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-holland>Tom Holland</h2><p>Tom Holland doesn’t just play the role of your friendly neighborhood <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider Man</a> in movies, he actively lives the superhero values in real life. For sick children, he became a superhero when he personally delivered $1 million worth of toys to a hospital. However, just like Spider Man, he wanted to do more.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Marvel: Every Phase 2 MCU Movie Ranked By Box Office Earnings</a></span></p><p>He has since put together a foundation with his family, called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Brothers Trust</a>. The aim of this organization is to shed light on lesser-known charities struggling in the noisy and competitive not-for-profit sector. On the site, dog collars made by women in Nairobi running their own businesses are for sale.</p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth>Chris Hemsworth</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a>’s talents are not just limited to playing superhero Thor in the Marvel series. He is also a philanthropist who passionately supports the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Children’s Foundation (ACF)</a>. The mission of the ACF is to advocate for and support children who have been the victims of trauma, violence, or abuse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hemsworth’s whole family has worked with ACF as advocates. Taking it one step further, Hemsworth also worked on a project with ACF where he voiced animated characters in their media designed to teach children problem-solving skills and healthy calming techniques. These gestures are nothing short of heroic to children in need.</p><h2 id=chris-pratt>Chris Pratt</h2><p>While Star Lord may be busy cruising the galaxies, actor Chris Pratt is making heroic strides right here on planet Earth. A quick internet search will reveal that Pratt has been involved in many different low-key philanthropy efforts.</p><p>More recently, he offered up his own time in exchange for $10 donations to the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Brain Treatment Foundation</a>, which works closely with veterans. In exchange for the $10 donation, fans automatically enter to win a chance to hang out with the actor on the set of his latest film while staying in a fancy hotel suite. His actions raised funds and awareness for traumatic brain injuries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebs You Didn't Know Traded Their Body For Money</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9Kup56qmJq%2FsHnAnKuoqqNiv6aty2ajop6VYsGwu44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-a-listers-lewis-hamilton-has-been-linked-to-10-he-d-be-a-good-match-for.html><span>←</span><span>10 A-Listers Lewis Hamilton Has Been Linked To (10 He'd Be A Good Match For)</span></a>
