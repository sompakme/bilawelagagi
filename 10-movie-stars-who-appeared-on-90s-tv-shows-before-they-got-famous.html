For a lot of them, that "somewhere" was television. A few of your current faves were attempting to come out on top for a long time, and a lot of them were discovered in small roles in the <a href=#>old '90s TV shows</a>. These shows may have been very popular back in the day (and, let's be honest, now too), however, these celebs were&nbsp;not, which means you most likely missed one of their first believed roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To 90s Star Joey Lawrence?</a></span></p><p>In this article, we will be taking a look at how 10 big celebrities got their start. Most of them didn't get huge roles their first go around, but that doesn't mean they can't be appreciated for these roles! Without further ado, here are 10 movie stars who appeared on '90s shows before they got famous.</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jessica Alba</span></h2><p>If you have forgotten about the '90s gem that was&nbsp;The Secret World Of Alex Mack (available to stream on Amazon Prime), let me jog your memory real quick. Fun fact: <a href=#><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></a>&nbsp;made her first TV appearance as one of the original characters. She played a character named <a href=#>Jessica</a>&nbsp;(pretty easy to remember, right?), the girlfriend of Alex's crush Scott Greene, who was snobby, disrespectful, and unkind to Alex all the time. She can be seen in the pilot and two other episodes before moving on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leighton-meester><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Leighton Meester</span></h2><p>It is still difficult to imagine&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Leighton Meester</a>&nbsp;</strong>as anyone other than Blair Waldorf. However, years before she snagged that role on&nbsp;Gossip Girl, Leighton can be seen in an entirely different show:&nbsp;7th Heaven (available to stream on Hulu). Leighton played a tutor named <a href=#>Kendall</a>&nbsp;with mean-girl vibes in the two-part finale of the show's eighth season.</p><h2 id=gabrielle-union><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gabrielle Union</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#><strong>Gabrielle Union</strong></a>&nbsp;is most well known for her flawless performances in enormous movies such as&nbsp;Bring It On&nbsp;and&nbsp;10 Things I Hate About You. However, before all of that, she was on&nbsp;7th Heaven&nbsp;for a little while. Gabrielle played Mary's friend Keesha Hamilton in season one, and she was in five episodes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Beloved 90s Actor Wasn't Easy To Deal With Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><h2 id=ellen-pompeo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ellen Pompeo</span></h2><p>Before <a href=#><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a>&nbsp;played Dr. Meredith Grey on&nbsp;Grey's Anatomy&nbsp;for nearly two decades, she got her start on&nbsp;Friends (available to stream on HBO Max). Ross and Chandler fought over her character <a href=#>Missy</a> on just one episode of the hit sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=milo-ventimiglia><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Milo Ventimiglia</span></h2><p>This just may be the&nbsp;oddest thing you read today. Before snatching the&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;role that made him a well-known heartthrob, <a href=#><strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong></a>&nbsp;had an extremely tiny part in&nbsp;The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air&nbsp;(available to stream on HBO Max). He played a party guest and had a few small lines.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To 90s Actor Skeet Ulrich?</a></span></p><h2 id=linda-cardellini><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Linda Cardellini</span></h2><p>Before starring in&nbsp;Freaks And Geeks, Bloodline, and Dead To Me, <a href=#><strong>Linda Cardellini</strong></a>&nbsp;can be seen on TV in an episode of&nbsp;3rd Rock From The Sun (available to stream on Amazon Prime)&nbsp;as Lorna. Also, she is well-known for being seen as Velma in the live-action&nbsp;Scooby-Doo&nbsp;movies and Laura Barton in the Avengers movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-kunis><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mila Kunis</span></h2><p><a href=#><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;just one more celebrity who had one of their first significant acting roles on&nbsp;7th Heaven. For two episodes, she played Ashley, the rebellious girl who by some means became friends with Lucy&nbsp;and started some major drama in the family. Also, you can find Mila in&nbsp;Baywatch, another successful '90s show. She can be seen in two&nbsp;separate episodes playing two separate characters. First, she was a young student named Annie, and a year later, she played Bonnie, a girl who got lost while hiking.</p><h2 id=ashley-tisdale><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ashley Tisdale</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before becoming a Disney star well-known for playing Sharpay in the&nbsp;High School Musical&nbsp;movies, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a>&nbsp;made the rounds on numerous '90s sitcoms as a young actress. On the show&nbsp;Smart Guy&nbsp;(available to stream on Disney+), she played T.J.'s&nbsp;game show opponent.</p><h2 id=craig-robinson><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Craig Robinson</span></h2><p>Do not mind the major&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;vibes this is giving off right now. Before <a href=#><strong>Craig Robinson</strong></a> appeared on the workplace comedy/sitcom&nbsp;The Office, he can be seen on an episode of&nbsp;Friends. He had an extremely minor part as a store clerk talking to Phoebe during the final season of the show. So basically, we can thank Craig Robinson for giving us, Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joseph-gordon-levitt><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</span></h2><p>One of the biggest film stars at the moment, <strong><a href=#>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>&nbsp;</strong>grew up on television, being seen as Tommy Solomon in&nbsp;3rd Rock From The Sun. However, before that, he played D.J.'s friend <a href=#>George</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Roseanne&nbsp;(available to stream on Amazon Prime)&nbsp;for a short period of time.</p><p>We're&nbsp;sure that you completely&nbsp;failed to notice some of these movies stars' first believed roles (like Milo Ventimiglia in&nbsp;Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, who would have thought that?) Also, perhaps you did not value them back in the day, but that does not mean you can't now! (thank you streaming services).</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's What Happened To These Forgotten Actresses Of The '90s</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqK6Zmnq0wMCrqmavmKR6orzPnpirnZRivK95mGmqZqymYsCpu9asZJudlqS%2FpnnToZyyZZekwW6ywKamrqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tsukumo-sana-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Tsukumo Sana Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
