This notion leads us to believe that celebrities are supposed to be nice all the time. However, celebs are just like everyone else. They have good days and bad days. They experience the same spectrum of emotions - happy, sad, angry, and downright pissed off.&nbsp;Unfortunately, a fan can get an awful encounter with a celeb on one of their bad days and experience the bad side they thought simply didn't exist. It is worth noting that each celebrity encounter story is a personal retelling by an individual and is hearsay. Here are 14 of the absolute worst stories of celebrity fan encounters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez>14. Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>While staying at the luxury hotel Melia Duesseldorf, <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> got one of the maids fired from her job. The maid requested an autograph from the superstar and not only was she denied but also was later fired after Lopez complained to management. The maid told the German newspaper Bild, "I cleaned on her floor. And I am an incredibly big fan so I took all my courage and rang the bell to get an autograph.&nbsp;But I was rejected by two assistants at the door.&nbsp;A day later the cleaning company that employed me at the hotel called and said that Ms. Lopez had complained. I was fired right there on the phone! Because of an autograph!"</p><p></p><h2 id=orlando-bloom>13. Orlando Bloom</h2><p>According to a worker at a menswear store in New York City, actor&nbsp;<a href=#>Orlando bloom</a>&nbsp;parked his motorcycle in the middle of the sidewalk directly in front of&nbsp;the store. He came in wearing baggy sweatpants and no shirt yelling, "Yo, is my bro back there?" He then walked around with the menswear manager for a few hours picking out clothes. When it came time to checkout, he asked if he was going to get the "Orlando Bloom is wearing your shirt discount."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=ariana-grande>12. Ariana Grande</h2><p><a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>&nbsp;is well-known for treating everyone around her like garbage. One example of this occurred when two young teen girls won a contest to meet Ariana. According to the teens, they took photos with the superstar, but then she demanded that the photos be deleted immediately after. Ariana spent less than a minute with them and the teens begged to keep the photos, but Grande told her security team to make sure the pictures were deleted.</p><p></p><h2 id=hugh-grant>11. Hugh Grant</h2><p>According to a bouncer at a pub, an encounter with <a href=#>Hugh Grant</a>&nbsp;left him thinking&nbsp;that the actor is an incredibly rude person. Grant had brought a young girl to a pub and when she wasn't let in because she didn't have a proper ID, Grant began yelling at the bouncer, "Do you know who I am?" and "I bet you don't even have an education." That's really rude for anyone to utter, let alone a celebrity.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-piven>10. Jeremy Piven</h2><p>In 2007, Entourage star&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeremy Piven</a>,&nbsp;along with twelve other friends, showed up at the restaurant Nobu Matsuisha in Aspen, Colorado, without reservations. The place was extremely crowded, but a table was still provided for the Hollywood star and his ‘entourage’. At the end of the evening as Piven was leaving the restaurant, he commented to the manager, “Thanks for nothing.” Jeremy also allegedly left Season one of Entourage as a tip for the waiter. Since the incident, the actor has been banned from all Nobu Matsuisha locations.</p><p></p><h2 id=rachael-ray>9. Rachael Ray</h2><p><a href=#>Rachael Ray</a> is well known for her down-to-earth 30-minute meals as well as being an all around diva. Many audience members at her shows throughout the years have confirmed that she's cold and unwelcoming when the cameras aren't rolling and the spotlight isn't on her. During one of the famous chef's tours, a hotel concierge had a horrible encounter with Rachael Ray. While speaking with her, Ray allegedly said, "I need stupid people not to talk to me." Ouch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=cameron-diaz>8. Cameron Diaz</h2><p>At a premiere for her film Sex Tape, <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> walked the red carpet which was lined with paparazzi and screaming fans (as these types of events typically are). The red carpet is meant for celebs to promote their projects and/or themselves, and interact with fans and paparazzi, evidently. However, Diaz doesn't see it that way. When fans asked to get a photo with Diaz her response was, “If I did it for you I’d have to do it for everyone,” and she then proceeded to walk away.</p><p></p><h2 id=britney-spears>7. Britney Spears</h2><p><a href=#>Britney Spears</a> is known for being awkward around her fans, but apparently, she can be downright rude too. While dining at a restaurant in Las Vegas, the singer wanted Starbucks coffee. According to her waiter, she&nbsp;asked him&nbsp;to run across the street and get her some coffee, which he did by the way. However, after she was done dining, Britney didn’t tip him, nor did she even reimburse him for her coffee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=catherine-zeta-jones>6. Catherine Zeta-Jones</h2><p>One eight-year-old girl was lucky enough&nbsp;to win a contest and get the chance to&nbsp;attend an advanced screening of The Mask of Zorro with the cast and crew. When she met her idol, actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, she excitedly told the star, her idol, "I want to be an actress too!" Zeta-Jones looked at the young eight year olf girl and allegedly said to her, "You're pretty enough, I suppose." That's just plain&nbsp;mean.</p><p></p><h2 id=megan-fox>5. Megan Fox</h2><p>Lots of attention (wanted or not) comes along with the territory of being both extremely beautiful and famous. Sometimes the attention can be quite annoying, especially when you're just trying to go about your day. Despite this, there's really no excuse for insulting your fans. According to a fan of <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>, he asked the star for an autograph on a street in San Diego. Fox allegedly responded by telling her bodyguard, "Get this disgusting creep away from me."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=niall-horan>4. Niall Horan</h2><p>One Direction member and heartthrob, <a href=#>Niall Horan</a> arrived at Dublin airport and was greeted by a group of Directioners (as they are probably greeted everywhere they go) screaming their adoring love for the pop star and taking photos. Horan was annoyed by them and was caught on video yelling that they were a "shower of c*nts." Now, that's a really bad celebrity encounter.</p><p></p><h2 id=janet-jackson>3. Janet Jackson</h2><p>According to a&nbsp;hotel worker in Dallas, before <a href=#>Janet Jackson</a> entered the hotel, a group of her security guards came in to instruct everyone to stop&nbsp;what they were doing and stand behind a line with their eyes downward. Jackson apparently had demanded that nobody even look at her. Clearly, the hotel staff all had an awful encounter with&nbsp;Jackson, since they weren't even allowed to look at her, let alone talk to her.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-levine>2. Adam Levine</h2><p><a href=#>Adam Levine</a>, the lead singer of "maps" group Maroon 5 isn't as sweet as the songs he sings, and&nbsp;apparently, he doesn't have time for the less fortunate looking, either. According to one fan, when she asked Levine for an autograph, he not only refused, but he also replied, "I don't give autographs to ugly chicks." Now, that's just awful. We wonder what his now pregnant wife, <a href=#>Behati Prinsloo</a>&nbsp;thinks of that answer.</p><p></p><h2 id=justin-bieber>1. Justin Bieber</h2><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> is the king of horrible&nbsp;celebrity encounters. He's well known for losing his cool with fans and being downright disrespectful to them. There's even a photo of the pop star spitting on a gathering of Beliebers from his apartment balcony in Toronto, Canada. One of the worst celebrity encounters was when a fan approached Bieber on a beach. She was wearing a bikini and Bieber allegedly called her a "beached whale". Spectators reported that he also suggested that she try out for The Biggest Loser. Now that's really mean.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>thechive.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbF2ks27Ax55kmpqjpLm2wMRmrqiqo6l6pLHLnpmroaSueqa6wqisp6yVp8Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-robyn-lively-blake-lively-s-sister-here-s-everything-you-should-know.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Robyn Lively Blake Livelys Sister?
