When it comes to movies, television show, brand campaigns, fashion shows and more, A-listers are often approached first. Even better, these celebrities also tend to command a lot more money. For instance, A-list actors can command a $20-million paycheck for a single movie, even more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Hollywood, A-listers can typically be classified into two types: jerks and sweethearts. Having experienced incredible success, some A-listers like to stay modest and humble. These are the ones who remain nice and professional to their co-workers and fans. On the other hand, there are also a lot of A-listers who prefer to be rude to everyone. Here are some we found, along with two A-listers who are low-key sweethearts.</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-tobey-maguire><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Tobey Maguire</span></h2><p>It seems Tobey Maguire prefers to be called Tugboat Maguire. And so, it seems a fan upset him badly when she didn’t refer to him in this manner. According to a report from Clickhole, Maguire screamed at the fan saying, “I’m small but strong, just like a tugboat, so call me fucking ‘Tugboat Maguire.’ How hard can that possibly be?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-jerk-christian-bale><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Christian Bale</span></h2><p>As some fans have come to find out, “Batman” actor Christian Bale doesn’t really care for fans. According to Huffington Post, the star’s former publicist, Harrison Cheung, exposed Bale’s behavior with fans in a book, saying he would “lecture little girls about being rude and intrusive until tears streamed down their faces, and their parents tugged them away from our table.” Moreover, he also wanted a fan “eliminated” using “a screwdriver thrust thru the eyeball into the brain.”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-cuba-gooding-jr><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Cuba Gooding Jr.</span></h2><p>Academy award-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was often seen as someone who could do no wrong. However, recent events have proven this is not the case. In fact, just a few months ago, he was accused of groping a woman. He has since been charged with one misdemeanor count of forcible touching. According to Reuters, his trial is set for October 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-jerk-russell-crowe><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Russell Crowe</span></h2><p>Over the years, there had been reports of Russell Crowe getting into a brawl. And back in 2015, when the actor guested on the “Late Late Show,” Crowe apparently shouted at the audience for not clapping to him at the right time. According to a report from Independent.ie, he yelled, “If you’re going to clap, clap in time. If you can’t clap in time, just shut up.”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-sean-penn><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Sean Penn</span></h2><p>According to a report from Daily Mail, actor Sean Penn lost his temper after a fan attempted to take a photo of him while he was at the St. Regis hotel in San Francisco. One witness told TMZ that Penn “lunged” at the man. He also took the man’s phone and threw it at the floor. In addition, Penn was also heard saying, “I'll make you eat the phone... Get the f**k out of here. Get out of here!”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-ariana-grande><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Ariana Grande</span></h2><p>By all accounts, it seems that pop star Ariana Grande exhibits diva behavior. For starters, who could forget that she licked donuts at a bakery and yelled, “I hate America.” Meanwhile, Grande was also quick to diss her former co-stars in “Sam & Cat” and “Victorious.” In addition, reports have also surfaced that Grande sometimes demands that fans delete photos taken with her, something that blogger Dan O'Connor witnessed with his daughters in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-jerk-james-franco><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>A-List Jerk: James Franco</span></h2><p>According to a post on Thought Catalog, the encounter happened at a place where Franco allegedly hooked up with freshman girls. The post claimed, “He went up to one of the girls in the group and, without even saying hello, asked how old she was and if she wanted to meet up with him away from the group. When she said she had a boyfriend, he simply said, 'Well I guess this conversation is over' and walked away.”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-bruce-willis><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Bruce Willis</span></h2><p>Back in 2009, Willis had terrified a fan who was backstage at a New York fashion event. According to a report from Radar Online, the actor was clearly pissed when a fan got too close. The report alleged, “He was visibly angry, leaned in very close to her and put his finger right in her face. He then said, ‘Don’t you EVER touch me, understand?’ The (former) fan appeared shocked and frightened”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-jerk-lea-michele><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Lea Michele</span></h2><p>Apparently, the “Glee” star had snubbed celebrity fan Hailee Steinfeld at one point. During an interview with J-14, Steinfeld recalled, “I saw Lea Michele just walking to her trailer and I was like, "That's the girl from Glee. I've got to go ask for her autograph' So I walked up to her and asked for her autograph, but she walked by and a guy came and said, 'Sorry, now's not a good time'!”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-sandra-bullock><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Sandra Bullock</span></h2><p>According to reports, the incident occurred while Sandra Bullock was filming “The Heat” in Boston. During a filming break, Bullock had run into Denise Kodes and her veteran husband who was on a wheelchair. When her husband asked for an autograph, Kodes told Star Magazine, “Sandra was so rude. She covered her face and yelled. He just wanted an autograph, and she actually yelled at him!”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-catherine-zeta-jones><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Catherine Zeta-Jones</span></h2><p>According to a story posted on Reddit, a fan once approached Catherine Zeta-Jones and asked for an autograph for her little sister. Jones responded by yelling at her and calling her a “liar” before refusing to give her an autograph. Apparently, the woman was accused of simply wanting the autograph for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-jerk-rihanna><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Rihanna</span></h2><p>According to an account by user Abra-Used-Teleport on Mean Stars, “My coworker won free tickets and backstage passes to see Rihanna about a year after they were first playing "Umbrella" on the radio. When her kids finally got the chance to go meet Rihanna, she was sitting at her makeup booth and refused to face them, or even look at them. When they asked for her autograph, she told the closest backup dancer to forge it for them and shoo'd them away.”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-robert-pattinson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Robert Pattinson</span></h2><p>It seems the ‘Twilight’ star has some not-so-nice things to say about the fans of the successful franchise. In fact, Robert Pattinson once remarked to Interview magazine, “Twilight has its own fan culture that existed from day one. And in an intense way that didn't exist before. Sometimes I ask myself what these masses of people do the whole day. They sit in front of their computers and comment on anything having even remotely to do with Twilight.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-jerk-kate-winslet><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Kate Winslet</span></h2><p>The encounter reportedly occurred during a movie promotion back in 2012. Apparently, many fans waited in the rain to see the “Titanic” actress. However, when Kate Winslet arrived, she reportedly didn’t want anything to do with them. Local resident Shanna Swan even told OK!, “She gave dirty looks to people in my town who waited hours to see her.”</p><h2 id=a-list-jerk-laurence-fishburne><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>A-List Jerk: Laurence Fishburne</span></h2><p>A story on Mean Stars talked about a time when some high school students got the chance to meet Laurence Fishburne in person. According to the post, “We met all of the lead actors except for Laurence Fishburne, and the assistant went to find him. She discovered that he was in a trailer nearby, so she brought us over to the trailer and knocked on the door," the fan says. When the assistant told Fishburne there were some high school students who'd like to meet him, his reply was, "Tell 'em to go f**k themselves.””</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-list-sweetheart-jennifer-garner><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>A-List Sweetheart: Jennifer Garner</span></h2><p>As her fans would know, actress Jennifer Garner is an amazing and down-to-earth actress who likes to entertain people with a ‘fake’ cooking show on Instagram. Garner also got everyone emotion in June when she posted a pivotal scene from her movie “Love, Simon.” It was one where a teenage son decided to come out to his parents on Christmas morning. In the caption, she wrote, “Everyone coming out deserves to exhale. To be more you. Because you deserve everything you want.”</p><h2 id=a-list-sweetheart-george-clooney><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A-List Sweetheart: George Clooney</span></h2><p>Perhaps, it’s safe to say that everyone who has worked or met George Clooney has fallen in love with him. The veteran actor, after all, is a total sweetheart. In fact, Patrick Lael, who worked as extra on “Leatherheads,” wrote on Mean Stars, “While working as an extra on Leatherheads, I got to be around George for five days. He was always courteous, smiling and professional. He even bought all of a kid's lemonade just off the set with a $100 bill.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reference: Clickhole, Huffington Post, Independent.ie, Daily Mail, Thought Catalog, OK!, Reuters, Mean Stars</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqSZqMGmvtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnTqKuapF2isqK6yJ6qZpmemXq4tM5mmKudXaG8uHnKnrBmq6easrW0xJqpratf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-between-kunal-nayyar-and-kal-penn-on-the-big-bang-theory.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened Between Kunal Nayyar And Kal Penn On The Big Bang Theory?</span></a>
