When Gossip Girl first aired in 2007, we were all so hung up on Serena’s effortless It girl style and Blair’s modern and aspirational preppy aesthetic. Because of this, we almost overlooked the original rich mom — Lily van der Woodsen. One of the most iconic wealthy matriarchs of all time, van der Woodsen (played to perfection by Kelly Rutherford), really set the blueprint for how to dress like a rich mom."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Her wardrobe typically consisted of trench coats, structured totes, a scarf for an accessory and simple cashmere sweaters. Of course, she also had a closet full of ball gowns and midi dresses for charity luncheons as well. Her look was laid-back and casual, yet stylish and that’s exactly the type of vibe we want to emulate. Keep reading to get&nbsp; Lily Van Der Woodsen-approved rich mom style!</p><p><strong>1.
