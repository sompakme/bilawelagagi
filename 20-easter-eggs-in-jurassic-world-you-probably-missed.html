Its success can be partially attributed to how similar it is to the original Jurassic Park in a number of ways. Jurassic World is dripping with references to Jurassic Park, and there are even some nods to the other not nearly as beloved Jurassic Park sequels. These sly nods were one of the reasons Jurassic World has so much charm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s almost meta in a way how Jurassic World pays homage and tribute to the classic <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> film Jurassic Park. If you have seen the film, you probably noticed that the T. rex is the same one from Jurassic Park. You probably noticed how similar the scene where Indominus rex attacked the gyrosphere was to the scene in Jurassic Park where the T. rex attacked the Ford Explorer.</p><p>You probably even noticed Jake Johnson’s character Lowery Cruthers wearing and talking about a Jurassic Park shirt he bought on eBay – hopefully you saw that since it was one of the funniest moments in the movie. However, there were a lot more Easter eggs that weren’t nearly as noticeable if you don’t have eyesight as good as a Trodon. Here’s a look at 20 Easter eggs in Jurassic World you might not have noticed. Are there any others you’ve found? Lots of spoilers are ahead, so if you are one of the three people in the world that hasn’t seen Jurassic World, please don’t read this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-mr-dna><strong>20. Mr. DNA</strong></h2><p>The loveable Jurassic Park mascot Mr. DNA makes his return in Jurassic World. As Zach and Gray walk into the Samsung Innovation Center, at the park they are treated to plenty of ways to learn about dinosaurs, including an interactive display about the genetic make up of the creatures in the Jurassic World theme park.</p><p>This touch screen display features the cartoon version of the character just as he was seen in Jurassic Park, and he even has his trademark&nbsp;southern drawl. Gray quickly shows Mr. DNA how much scientific knowledge he has by easily answering all the questions about genetic code.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=19-t-rex-gets-revenge-on-spinosaurus><strong>19. T. rex gets revenge on Spinosaurus</strong></h2><p>In a nod to Jurassic Park III, actually it was more of a slam at Jurassic Park III, The T. rex in Jurassic World crashes through a Spinosaurus skeleton on the main drag of the Jurassic World theme park.</p><p>You may remember, or perhaps you were trying to forget, how easily a T. rex was defeated by the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park III. This Easter egg in Jurassic World was a sly way of saying that the T. rex is still king and always will be. No fish eater could ever really defeat the king of the dinosaurs.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-ian-malcolm-s-god-creates-dinosaurs><strong>18. Ian Malcolm’s God Creates Dinosaurs</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>Jeff Goldblum</a>’s Ian Malcolm didn’t make an in person appearance in Jurassic World, he was there in spirit in many ways. Ian Malcolm’s book titled God Creates Dinosaurs,&nbsp;appears a couple of times throughout the movie. First, we see it being read by Claire’s assistant Zara Young, played by Katie McGrath, as she is riding on the monorail with Zach and Grey.</p><p>We see the book again on the desk of Lowery Cruthers, played by Jake Johnson. Of course, God Creates Dinosaurs is a reference to the classic line from Jurassic Park uttered by Ian Malcolm. “God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs…”</p><p></p><h2 id=17-winston-s-steakhouse><strong>17. Winston’s Steakhouse</strong></h2><p>via www.jurassicworld.com</p><p>Among all the high-class eateries and cheap eats restaurants on the main drag of the Jurassic World theme park, you will find Winston’s steakhouse. This of course is a reference to the late legendary special effects guru Stan Winston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winston was a pioneer who was behind the development of the animatronic dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. He also was responsible for the special effects, robotics and make up in numerous other big-budget blockbusters including, the Lost World: Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park III, Predator, the Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and even Iron Man.</p><p></p><h2 id=16-the-mosasaurus-eats-a-shark><strong>16. The Mosasaurus eats a shark</strong></h2><p>via www.jurassicpark.wikia.com</p><p>The addition of this aquatic dinosaur to Jurassic World theme park (OK, it’s not actually a dinosaur) was one of the coolest new things to appear in the film. Its debut was also a sly nod to a classic Steven Spielberg film.</p><p>Before Spielberg made the sci-fi classic Jurassic Park, he made another terrifying monster movie that captured the imagination of audiences. That was of course Jaws. And what exactly does the Mosasaurus feed on when it’s time to put on a show for the visitors of Jurassic World? Why a great white shark of course, and it’s just like the one in Jaws.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=15-chilean-sea-bass><strong>15. Chilean sea bass</strong></h2><p>via www.iheartjurassicpark.com</p><p>At Winston’s Steakhouse there is more on the menu than just the finest prime beef in the world. If you were to visit Jurassic World you would also be treated to a dish consisting of Chilean sea bass.</p><p>You may recall that Chilean sea bass is what the executive chef at Jurassic Park had prepared for <a href=#>Richard Attenborough</a>’s John Hammond and his guests when Ian Malcolm, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler visited to examine the park in the original Jurassic Park film. You can also hear the announcer mention Chilean sea bass is on the menu over the intercom at the end of Jurassic World.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-jeep-wrangler-no-29><strong>14. Jeep Wrangler No. 29</strong></h2><p>via www.jurassicworld.org</p><p>I’m sure you noticed the classic Jeep Wrangler from the original Jurassic Park film that Zach and Gray fixed up to escape the Indominus rex in Jurassic World, but do you know which Jeep Wrangler it was?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was Jeep Wrangler number 29, which was the Jeep that transported John Hammond and Donald Gennaro to the valley where the Brachiosauruses were feeding in the first Jurassic Park film. <a href=#>Sam Neil</a>’s Alan Grant, <a href=#>Laura Dern</a>’s Ellie Sattler and Jeff Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm were traveling in Jeep Wrangler number 18 in Jurassic Park.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-rear-view-mirror-shots><strong>13. Rear-view mirror shots</strong></h2><p>via www.cinema.theiapolis.com</p><p>One of the most memorable and iconic shots in Jurassic Park was the scene when the T. rex is chasing the Jeep driven by Robert Muldoon. The T. rex was after Malcolm, Sattler and Muldoon, and it came very close to catching them. You will undoubtedly remember the shot of the T. rex in the side mirror of the Jeep during this captivating scene in Jurassic Park.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This shot was recreated in Jurassic World when Zach and Gray were driving a Jeep Wrangler from the old Jurassic Park visitor center to Jurassic World. They speedily try and make their way back to safety as the Pteranodons and Dimorphodons are let loose by the Indominus rex. The shot of the flying reptiles in the Jeep’s rear-view mirror in Jurassic World is eerily similar to the T. rex escape scene in Jurassic Park.</p><p>Later in the film, after the raptors turn on Owen and his crew, we see the vicious dinosaurs try and chase down the mobile vet van driven by Claire. Here there is another shot of dinosaurs in mid-chase as seen through the van’s side mirror.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-jimmy-fallon-s-cameo><strong>12. Jimmy Fallon’s cameo</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a>’s hilarious cameo features nods to the venomous nature of Dilophosaurus spit – which was spat into the face of <a href=#>Wayne Knight</a>’s Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park. Fallon’s cameo is also a nod to the Universal Studios theme parks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jimmy Fallon serves as the host of the Universal studio tour at Universal Studios Hollywood. The Tonight Show host serves as a guide at a real theme park, not just the fictional theme park of Jurassic World. Of course, Universal Studios made Jurassic World and the other films in the Jurassic Park franchise.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-gallimimus-stampede><strong>11. Gallimimus stampede</strong></h2><p>The scene where a vehicle transports visitors to the Jurassic World theme park through a herd of Gallimimus in Jurassic World is very similar to the shot in Jurassic Park, where the Gallimimus are running through the field to escape the T. rex that is looking to make one of them its prey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They flock just as birds do in both Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. The only thing different about the scene in Jurassic World from the shot in the original Jurassic Park movie is the vastly improved CGI effects.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-what-a-slob><strong>10. What a slob!</strong></h2><p>Jake Johnson’s Lowery Cruthers is one of the tech geniuses that helps operate Jurassic World, and Lowery shares many similar character traits to none other than Dennis Nedry from Jurassic Park. One similarity is their inability to keep a clean workspace.</p><p>Claire scolds Lowery to clean up his workstation and calls the mess on his desk chaotic. In Jurassic Park, <a href=#>Samuel L. Jackson</a>’s Ray Arnold comments that Nedry is a complete slob, as his desk is covered in candy wrappers and soda cans. Lowery and Dennis may both be pigs, but they are the complete opposite when it comes to reverence for dinosaurs. Lowery proved to be an unlikely hero in Jurassic World, while Nedry was a greedy villain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-the-original-gate-updated><strong>9. The original gate – updated</strong></h2><p>via www.jurassicpark.wikia.com</p><p>In Jurassic World, many of the aspects of the first park appear. The old visitor center from Jurassic Park is back. The Jeep Wranglers return, and so do the night vision goggles. It's also the first time a Jurassic Park movie has been set on Isla Nublar since the original. Zach even fashions a torch out of a dinosaur bone and the “When Dinosaurs Ruled the World” banner from Jurassic Park.</p><p>Perhaps the most iconic piece of construction from the original Jurassic Park theme park that shows up in Jurassic World is the massive entrance gate. Of course, it has been updated to say Jurassic World rather than Jurassic Park. The monorail announcer even mentions that the gate was salvaged and refurbished from the original theme park.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-multiple-tributes-to-john-hammond><strong>8. Multiple tributes to John Hammond</strong></h2><p>via www.uk.jurassicworldintl.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Jurassic World theme park would not be complete without paying respect to the man responsible for the vision of bringing dinosaurs back to life for theme parks. In Jurassic World, there are many nods to Richard Attenborough’s John Hammond.</p><p>There is a statue of him in the park’s visitor center – and it’s a statue that is quite similar to the one you would see of <a href=#>Walt Disney</a> at Disneyland. The lab where the geneticists create the test tube dinosaurs in Jurassic World is even named after him. It’s called the Hammond Creation Lab. Irrfan Khan’s Simon Masrani also mentions that Hammond entrusted him with the park as his dying wish.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-the-dilophosaurus-makes-an-appearance><strong>7. The Dilophosaurus makes an appearance</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many of the dinosaurs from other films in the Jurassic Park series appear in Jurassic World. Most famously is the exact same T. rex, but there are also raptors just like in every other Jurassic Park movie. The Stegosaurus is back, and so is the Triceratops.</p><p>Parasaurolophus has appeared before, as has Gallimimus and Ankylosaursus. There are new dinos like Apatosaurus, and of course the villainous Indominus rex. However, there is one returning dino in Jurassic World that appears in the film’s climax, but not in the flesh. The frilled and frightening Dilophosaurus makes its first appearance since Jurassic Park, but only in hologram form.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-jimmy-buffett-s-margaritaville><strong>6. Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville</strong></h2><p>via www.ageekdaddy.com</p><p>Among all the shops on the main drag of the Jurassic World theme park you will find restaurants like Nobu Sushi, Ben and Jerry’s and Starbucks. Just as like in Universal Studios, there is also a <a href=#>Jimmy Buffett</a>’s Margaritaville.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does Jimmy Buffett’s restaurant appear in Jurassic World, but he does, too. As the flying reptiles attack the park’s visitors he runs for cover clutching his drinks – getting impaled by a Pteranodon is horrible, but spilling your alcohol is even worse.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-chaos-theory-in-effect><strong>5. Chaos theory in effect</strong></h2><p>via tumblr.com</p><p>In Jurassic Park, mathematician Ian Malcolm talks about chaos theory and how nothing can really be controlled. He demonstrates this phenomenon by using droplets of water rolling off Ellie Sattler’s hand to explain it. The water droplets roll off in opposite directions.</p><p>In Jurassic World the same principle is in effect, but instead of water it’s blood. Droplets of blood land on an asset containment unit trooper, as they drip from the trees in the jungle where the Indominus rex is hiding. The droplets roll off his arm in opposite directions.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-dinos-still-have-to-eat><strong>4. The dinos still have to eat</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The way the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are fed is quite similar to the way they are fed in Jurassic World. In Jurassic Park we saw the Velociraptors tear apart a whole steer as it was lowered into their enclosure. In Jurassic World it is mentioned the only relationship the Indominus rex has is to the crane that gives it a steer to eat.</p><p>When it comes to the meal of choice for the T. rex once again, the goat is what it likes to eat. In Jurassic Park it is lured out with a goat that rises up from a feeing area underneath its enclosure. In Jurassic World the same thing happens, and the T. rex also associates red glowing flares with feeding time in both films.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-casting-another-director><strong>3. Casting another director</strong></h2><p>When Steven Spielberg made Jurassic Park he wanted the best person for the roll of John Hammond, so he eventually decided on fellow director Richard Attenborough. Attenborough directed the cinematic masterpiece Ghandi, and even won an Oscar for directing that film starring <a href=#>Ben Kingsley</a>. Interestingly enough, Steven Spielberg was also up for the best directing Oscar in 1983 for E.T., but of course, lost to Attenborough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow had his hand in casting a director as well. The Incredibles, Tomorrowland, Ratatouille&nbsp;and Mission Impossible – Ghost Protocol director Brad Bird has a cameo in Jurassic World. He is the announcer on the Jurassic World monorail as it enters the park.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-henry-wu-is-back-with-an-expanded-role><strong>2. Henry Wu is back with an expanded role</strong></h2><p>B.D Wong’s Henry Wu is back as the chief geneticist in Jurassic World. He is the only returning character from Jurassic Park. He is also much more villainous this time around, which certainly wasn’t something that was touched on in Jurassic Park, seeing as he was only in Jurassic Park for about a minute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wu’s expanded role in Jurassic World is fitting considering he was a major character in <a href=#>Michael Circhton</a>’s Jurassic Park novel, but got very little screen time in the film adaptation. Henry Wu’s portrayal in the Jurassic Park film and in Jurassic World is a perfect example of how vastly different the Jurassic Park film franchise is from Crichton’s two Jurassic Park books: Jurassic Park and The Lost World.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-dinosaur-poop><strong>1. Dinosaur poop</strong></h2><p>This one actually doesn’t appear in Jurassic World, but it was supposed to. However, the scene was cut from the final print of the film. In the TV spots for Jurassic World,&nbsp;there was a shot of <a href=#>Bryce Dallas Howard</a>’s Claire Dearing covering herself in dino droppings to mask her scent. <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a>’s Owen Grady jokingly says she didn’t have to put it on her face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was of course not the first time that dino poop was featured in the Jurassic Park franchise. In Jurassic Park, Ian Malcolm jokes: “That’s one big pile of sh*t,” after looking at a six foot pile of Triceratops turds. In Jurassic Park III, Alan Grant and crew must dig through Spinosaurus dung to get the satellite phone.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>imdb.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZraF2arrTAxKtknp%2BXqHqquoyjrKuZo6i2pHnWqKmlnF2uvLZ5z6umm5mSocZuucisqp6cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrities-who-dated-over-50-people-some-over-1-000.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrities Who Dated Over 50 People (Some Over 1,000!)</span></a>
