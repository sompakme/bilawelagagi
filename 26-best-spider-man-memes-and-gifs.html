And what's the best way to measure something's importance on the internet? Why, the number of memes that spring from it, of course!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With over 50 years of Spider-Man canon to draw from, the meme potential surrounding this one character is impressive, to say the least. But, given the internet's short attention span and general distrust of anything pre-digital, much of what exists stems from the recent live-action films starring a handful of Academy Award-winning and nominated actors and also <a title="Kirsten Dunst Net Worth" href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a>.</p><p>To the memes!</p><h2 id=all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end><strong>All Good Things Must Come to an End</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a title="Andrew Garfield Net Worth" href=#>Andrew Garfield</a> mercifully put an end to Toby Maguire's five year reign of terror, during which he tried to convince us he was an action hero. Speaking of Toby trying too hard...</p><h2 id=shazam><strong>SHAZAM!</strong></h2><p>This is actually the manliest Toby Maguire has ever looked.</p><p><a title="Tobey Maguire Net Worth" href=#>Maguire</a> didn't even know he was being filmed in the above scene. He thought he was alone on that rooftop.</p><h2 id=it-s-oddly-mesmerizing><strong>It's Oddly Mesmerizing</strong></h2><p>There's a joke here somewhere. But it's probably best to just play it safe and move on.</p><h2 id=james-franco-god-s-gift-to-james-franco><strong>James Franco: God's Gift to James Franco</strong></h2><p>It's just gonna go right to my hips but I'm being bad today, you guys!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="James Franco Net Worth" href=#>Franco</a> really is a gifted actor. It's pretty difficult to convey "creepy narcissist" in a two second GIF, but you wouldn't know it by watching this.</p><p><strong>AAAAAAAAGGGHHHH......[Thud]</strong></p><p>This is actually what spiders do when they see themselves in the mirror. Kind of like when a cat claws at its own reflection, but less adorable and only slightly more terrifying.</p><h2 id=booty-1><strong>Booty #1</strong></h2><p>And clench...and rest...and clench...and rest...and this is how we keep in shape...and...</p><p>The internet seems to be have an odd fascination with Spidey's butt. Here he is clenching those magnificent glutes as he surveys New York from on high.</p><h2 id=booty-2><strong>Booty #2</strong></h2><p>Most people don't know that Peter Parker is a huge Bubba Sparxxx fan. But who isn't?</p><p>Here he is working some Zumba into his daily routine.</p><h2 id=booty-3><strong>Booty #3</strong></h2><p>Very meta.</p><p>And here he is just hanging with a new friend.</p><h2 id=say-cheese><strong>Say Cheese!</strong></h2><p>Very meta.</p><p>Passive-aggressiveness is one of Spider-Man's lesser known powers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stan-lee-s-cameo><strong>Stan Lee's Cameo</strong></h2><p>"Annnd, done! 20,000 books scanned, categorized, and stacked neatly on the shelves. Now, I'll just turn to my right to make sure there aren't any radioactive monsters fighting in my library and... AWWW COME ON!!!!"</p><p>The Marvel Comics creator's frequent cameos in films based on his characters have become fan favorites over the years.</p><h2 id=don-t-look-behind-you><strong>Don't Look Behind You!</strong></h2><p>"Hey, you're not Mary Jane!"</p><p>Out of context, this scene is all kinds of creepy. Even in context it's a little disconcerting.</p><h2 id=memories-of-a-haunted-past><strong>Memories of a Haunted Past</strong></h2><p>It was bound to happen sooner or later. Still, it kinda tugs at your heartstrings, doesn't it?</p><h2 id=it-s-all-about-maintaining-your-secret-identity><strong>It's All About Maintaining Your Secret Identity</strong></h2><h2 id=the-lion-the-radioactive-spider-themed-superhero-and-the-wardrobe><strong>The Lion, the Radioactive Spider-Themed Superhero and the Wardrobe</strong></h2><p>"Wait a second! This is the box my fridge came in."</p><h2 id=we-finally-learn-the-truth><strong>We Finally Learn the Truth</strong></h2><p>This one also could have been filed under "Booty" given where his webbing apparently originates from.</p><h2 id=on-second-thought><strong>&nbsp;On Second Thought...</strong></h2><p>Forget what I said earlier. This man is a god!</p><h2 id=emo-spider-man-doesnt-care-what-people-think><strong>Emo Spider-Man Doesnt Care What People Think</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes caring what people think isn't such a bad thing. For instance, had Peter here been more responsive to outside criticism, he might have been able to spare the world the indignity of having to look at that second-grader's haircut and mock turtleneck combo he's rocking up there.</p><h2 id=look-familiar><strong>Look Familiar?</strong></h2><p>There are literally hundreds of memes floating around the net (people still call it the net, right?) all based on this classic screenshot of <a title="Tobey Maguire Net Worth" href=#>Tobey Maguire</a> at his absolute best.</p><h2 id=sometimes-the-simplest-are-the-best><strong>Sometimes the Simplest Are the Best</strong></h2><p>This song will now be stuck in your head for the rest of the day. You're welcome.</p><h2 id=fabulous><strong>Fabulous</strong></h2><p>Side note: why would anyone aspire to move like <a title="Mick Jagger Net Worth" href=#>Mick Jagger</a>? Never understood that one.</p><h2 id=hmm-that-s-a-little-unsettling><strong>Hmm, That's a Little Unsettling</strong></h2><p>Maybe it's all a misunderstanding. After all, look how he's holding that pen. This might just be a brave, albeit very misguided, attempt by Spider-Man to save the world from what he thinks is Hitler's second coming.</p><h2 id=hail-caesar><strong>Hail Caesar!</strong></h2><p>Damn, Oscorp was in to some heavy stuff.</p><h2 id=missed-opportunities><strong>Missed Opportunities</strong></h2><p>But think of how great it could have been...</p><h2 id=if-only><strong>If Only</strong></h2><p>Cap: "Back off, Parker. We got this."<br></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iron Man: "Yeah, I hear there's a big lizard causing some minor traffic disturbances in Midtown. Why don't you go keep an eye on that for us?"</p><p>Sony Pictures owns the rights to Spider-Man and would never let him appear in another studio's films. Too bad...</p><h2 id=but-at-least-he-s-got-that-nerdy-charm-girls-love><strong>But At Least He's Got that Nerdy Charm Girls Love</strong></h2><p>Still, he looks like he could do some damage with that metal staff he's brandishing. Wait, on second thought, it might just be a broom handle. Oh well.</p><h2 id=this-looks-familiar><strong>This Looks Familiar</strong></h2><p><a title="Jamie Foxx Net Worth" href=#>Jamie Foxx</a>'s portrayal of Spider-Man's nemesis Electro has been getting a lot of press in the lead up to the film's premiere. Some of it good, some of it bad. Most of the bad press stems from the fact that he looks alarmingly like <a title="Arnold Schwarzenegger Net Worth" href=#>Arnold&nbsp;Schwarzenegger</a>'s portrayal of this man:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3xzgoybnKysXai9qrDEq2SmmZ5iuqa5xKxkmqaUYrSqstJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wyc-grousbeck-net-worth-how-much-is-grousbeck-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Wyc Grousbeck Net Worth How Much is Grousbeck Worth?</span></a>
