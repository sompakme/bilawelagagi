Whether completely made up or suddenly taking on new weight, words and phrases evolve&nbsp;rapidly to fit the fast-paced, fickle environment of the internet and media. But it seems that as quickly as they rise to prominence, they just as suddenly become overused and annoying. We’ve compiled a list of 26 words that have recently become so tiresome that we really wouldn't mind eliminating them from the English language for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selfie>26. Selfie</h2><p>The term “Selfies” was catchy and convenient when it was coined, but now the term has become as overused and annoying as selfies themselves. If you’re tired of this word, you’re not alone: it was #1 on <a href=#>Lake Superior State University’s 2014 list of banished words</a>.</p><h2 id=whatever>25. Whatever</h2><p>Rated <a href=#>the most annoying word in 2013</a> in a Huffington Post poll, this is one that I would not mind saying goodbye to.</p><h2 id=vortex>24. Vortex</h2><p>I'm feeling bitter towards the person who thought it would be a good idea to refer to weather in “vortex” terms. “Polar vortex” feels like it belongs to the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, not used in mundane local news reports about winter weather. We thought this would go out of fashion as soon as the cold winter ended, but unfortunately spring has brought about a “<a href=#>pollen vortex</a>.”</p><h2 id=snowmageddon-and-snowpocalypse>23. Snowmageddon and snowpocalypse</h2><p>These are other byproducts of a particularly severe winter in the U.S. this year. Let’s just hope nobody coins the term “pollageddon” for the pollen this spring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=twerking>22. Twerking</h2><p>Coming in second on&nbsp;<a href=#>Lake Superior State University’s 2014 lis</a>t, I can’t wait for this one to go. How many more times do we have to hear this word, which evokes unsavory images of <a title="Miley Cyrus Net Worth" href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> writhing onstage? I would&nbsp; also love to firmly banish any pun, i.e. “twerking hard” from usage.</p><h2 id=anything>21. #anything</h2><p>Slapping a hashtag in front of too many words is more often than not obnoxious. And it’s simply unforgivable when “hashtag” is said out loud in a verbal conversation.</p><h2 id=i-can-t-or-i-just-can-t>20. "I can’t"&nbsp;(or “I just can’t”)</h2><p>Yes, we get it, something is so overwhelming that you can’t articulate your feelings properly.</p><h2 id=totes>19. Totes</h2><p>It’s “totes” time for this annoying shortened version of “totally” to bid us adieu.</p><h2 id=hack>18. Hack</h2><p>“Life hacks” were clever when we first heard the term used, but now everything and anything can suddenly be a “hack.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=like>17. Like</h2><p>It might be hard to eliminate this word completely from the English language, but it has become desperately overused in recent years thanks to Facebook. This was also rated the second most annoying word in the <a href=#>Huffington Post survey</a>.</p><h2 id=cray-or-cray-cray>16. Cray or “cray cray”</h2><p>Another abbreviated word that only takes 1 more letter to complete.</p><h2 id=preggo-or-preggers>15. Preggo or preggers</h2><p>A babyish term for pregnancy....</p><h2 id=nuff-said>14. “‘nuff said.”</h2><p>Is it really necessary to drop the “e” in front of enough? Does that actually save anybody any time?</p><h2 id=haters>13. Haters</h2><p>This word has been around for a few years, but continues to be irritating. “Haters gonna hate” - we get it, the point has been made by now, thanks.</p><h2 id=yolo>12. YOLO</h2><p>You Only Live Once… unless you are this phrase, in which case we cannot seem to get rid of you.</p><h2 id=swag>11. Swag</h2><p>Evoking the excesses of fame and fortune, this word has lost its sheen and become tiresome.</p><h2 id=just-wow>10. “Just wow”</h2><p>Another expression that conveys you are so overwhelmed by something that you can’t think of words to properly articulate your feels. Just no.</p><h2 id=smh>9. SMH</h2><p>The abbreviation for “shaking my head” is approaching a “LOL” level of over-use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amazeballs>8. Amazeballs</h2><p>Maybe it’s just me, but I always thought this expression was kind of gross?</p><h2 id=awesomesauce>7. Awesomesauce</h2><p>I’m not sure how this word ever got to be awesome? If you’re still using it… don’t.</p><h2 id=o-m-g>6. O.M.G</h2><p>An ubiquitous expression that’s going to be hard to eliminate from the English language, but added this to the list because it is especially annoying in a twee, overly-cheerful context.</p><h2 id=tl-dr>5. tl;dr</h2><p>Netslang for “too long, didn’t read”… it’s rude when someone replies to a long (and particularly thoughtful) comment with this expression. Plus it comes off as simply unintelligent: way to admit that you are too lazy to read something.</p><h2 id=tweetup>4. Tweetup</h2><p>This was cute in 2009, but why anyone still refers to a Tweetup is beyond me.</p><h2 id=idk-idek-or-idc-idec>3. IDK, IDEK or IDC, IDEC</h2><p>This acronym for “I don’t (even) know” is another pointless reply for something online. The third acronym (IDC) is just charming, meaning "I don't care" or the extra special "I don't even care."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=going-forward>2. Going forward</h2><p>Most often used in corporate contexts to introduce ideas that are, incidentally, not always that forward thinking.</p><h2 id=bromance>1. Bromance</h2><p>I have to admit, I am a little bit fond of this term, but be careful with it: it has the potential to be overdone any second now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3x0fIyepaCkmai1bsPOq5usZaCdv6K%2FxKxksJ2UYrmqt8Rmq6hll5rBbr7InWSonl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-was-the-cruelest-twist-that-survivor-s-producers-ever-included.html><span>←</span><span>What was the cruelest twist that Survivor's producers ever included?</span></a>
