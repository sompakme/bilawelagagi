We all know just how much success he has received in the past couple years with his Hotboxin' podcast series thanks to his compelling interviews. Now, in a strange time of uncertainty in light of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a> pandemic, he released a new mini-podcast series of sorts exclusively on YouTube called Safe Distance, where he interviews guests like Dana White and Tracy Morgan for a few minutes at a time over video calls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On either show, it is clear that Mike Tyson continues to have a large list of guests to choose from every time, but don't mistake that for thinking that Tyson is so willing to just let any and everyone on to his shows. There are some people who his beef with is so deep that they have practically been banned at this point. Here are some examples.</p><h2 id=banned-brad-pitt><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Banned: Brad Pitt</strong></span></h2><p>In a story we have all probably heard by now because Tyson has told it so many times these past few years, Tyson caught a young <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> fooling around with Robin Givens in the middle of their divorce. It doesn't seem like there are any hard feelings from Tyson, but we doubt he'd in invite Pitt on to reminisce on their mutual ex.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Women Brad Pitt Is Close To (5 He Stays Away From)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=invite-triple-h><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Invite:&nbsp;Triple H</strong></span></h2><p>When he dabbled his hand with wrestling for a bit heading into WrestleMania 14, Mike Tyson teamed with Triple H and Shawn Michaels to join DX. Despite turning on them, Tyson returned in 2009 for a DX reunion. He and Triple H still keep contact and are friendly enough that a podcast appearance doesn't sound impossible.</p><h2 id=banned-robin-givens><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Banned: Robin Givens</strong></span></h2><p>Speaking of Tyson's famous ex, Robin Givens likely is not going to be a guest on Tyson's podcast, nor is it likely that she would even want to come on. Due to the nasty nature of their divorce and why their divorce, it seems as though they have not even spoken since those proceedings first took place.</p><h2 id=invite-hulk-hogan><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Invite: Hulk Hogan</strong></span></h2><p>Another wrestler who Mike Tyson has maintained a relationship with is arguably the most successful wrestler of all time, Hulk Hogan. Much like Triple H, there were plans for a match between the two in Tyson's prime that fell through, but the two were able to become friends afterward.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Wrestling Rumors Hulk Hogan Never Talks About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=banned-jadakiss><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Banned: Jadakiss</strong></span></h2><p>Mike Tyson had a very bad encounter with the rapper the last time they crossed paths. Not only did the ex-boxer have the gall to show up to a Biggie Small tribute party unannounced at the Hq2 Nightclub, but in the process, he stole Jadakiss' seat. Both disrespected one another and it would not likely be mended with merely a podcast talking session.</p><h2 id=invite-evander-holyfield><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Invite: Evander Holyfield</strong></span></h2><p>Given that the last time these two stepped in the ring together, Mike Tyson should probably still have Evander Holyfield as a rival. Miraculously, they managed to become the best of friends after the infamous incident. Not only had Holyfield been on the podcast already, but given their friendship, it is likely he will show up again anytime.</p><h2 id=banned-mitch-green><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Banned: Mitch Green</strong></span></h2><p>It is surprising and somewhat commendable to think about how Mike Tyson has gone out of his way to mend fences with his past boxing rivals, but don't expect him to add Mitch Green to that list of new friends anytime soon. After a bad street fight that left Green battered, Green sued Tyson&nbsp;and received $45,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=invite-chris-brown><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Invite: Chris Brown</strong></span></h2><p>It's surprising to think Brown has yet to be on the podcast, but it only seems like a matter of time at this point. When Brown had his own violent tendencies, Tyson reached out to mentor Brown and help him direct that anger into productive, non-violent places. Although, when Brown wanted to fight Soulja Boy, Tyson still had his back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About Rihanna And Chris Brown That Have Recently Surfaced</a></span></p><h2 id=banned-floyd-mayweather><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Banned: Floyd Mayweather</strong></span></h2><p>One would think that because the two former boxers were touted as the best boxers of their respective generations, they should be able to get along just fine, but perhaps because of egos larger than life, they could never hit it off the right way. They only had desires to hit each other, which thankfully they have yet to act on. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Though Tyson came pretty close once.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=invite-wack-100><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Invite: Wack 100</strong></span></h2><p>Manager to the likes of The Game and Blueface, Wack 100 went back and forth on Instagram with Mike Tyson regarding who won an alleged fight between them. As it turns out, they never fought at all and it was a publicity stunt to promote their podcast episode. For them to joke like that, they must be really good friends.</p><h2 id=banned-soulja-boy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Banned: Soulja Boy</strong></span></h2><p>Remember earlier when we said that Tyson had Chris Brown's back in his beef with Soulja Boy? Well, Soulja took the backing to heart and said some unkind words to Tyson during multiple interviews. This compelled Tyson to respond in the most non-violent way he could think of: by releasing a rap diss called "If you Show Up - Soulja Boy Diss Song."</p><h2 id=invite-joe-budden><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Invite: Joe Budden</strong></span></h2><p>Along with his podcast co-hosts, Mal and Rory, Joe Budden guest-starred on Mike Tyson's podcast and the two hit it off rather nicely to the point they discussed "doing the toad" together. Do not be surprised if they do the toad live on the air for a trippy episode of the podcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=banned-michael-blackson><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Banned: Michael Blackson</strong></span></h2><p>As a comedian, Michael Blackson cracks jokes on everyone in the industry. No one goes unscratched, not even the baddest man on the planet. But Blackson may have crossed the line when he commented on a meme about Tyson's daughter being ugly. Now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per a DM to Blackson</a>&nbsp;(although Tyson denies it), Tyson wants to "knock the black off" Blackson.</p><h2 id=invite-eminem><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Invite: Eminem</strong></span></h2><p>About a month or so ago, Mike Tyson&nbsp;took part in the music video for Eminem's "Godzilla." Afterward, he asked his fans via Instagram if they wanted Em on his podcast. After a resounding yes, Eminem showed up to Hotboxin'. Given the strong positive reception to the episode, we shouldn't be surprised if Tyson invites Em on again.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Celebs Who Praise Eminem (And 6 Who Think He's Overrated)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhuZqiVpL2tsYytn5qsXZa%2FpnnBmqWnnZRis7O7zGakoqOVYsG6v86nqmaon5mwor%2FTZm5moJWhuW6ty7CYsqtdnru3tdOeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrities-who-begged-for-money.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrities Who Begged For Money</span></a>
