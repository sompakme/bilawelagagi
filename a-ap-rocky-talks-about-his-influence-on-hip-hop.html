Before commenting that he’d rather be atop the list or not on it at all, the rapper dropped by Big Boy’s Neighborhood radio show where he first heard the <a href=# id=auto-tag_news_3 data-tag=news>news</a>. Among his first reaction to his spot on the list the young star from Harlem also talked about his rise to fame.</p><p>Honestly, you know, when it’s happening to you, you’re oblivious to everything,” he said. “So I would prefer to stay this way because it keep me kind of humble and grounded.”</p><p>After chatting about preparing for his upcoming tour with Rihanna, wanting to maintain his youth, being an “international ass slapper and cutting his braids, Lord Flack was hit with his placement on the MTV list, which he was not so happy to hear. He proceeded to state his case for why he should have been ranked higher on the controversial list.</p><p>“What young cat my age is directing their own videos? What young cat is influencing hip-hop culture and fashion culture at the same time? Look how young I am. I’m the first rapper to be on the cover of VOGUE Magazine, the first rapper,” he said. “And I’m proud of that, I take pride in that. That’s a dream; I never thought they’d put a black kid from Harlem with gold teeth and braids on the front of Vogue, you know what I’m saying? What other artist you know got their album leaked a month and a week early and I’m still blessed. And it’s because I’m trying to work hard, so how you gonna put me at No. 8, bruh?”</p><p>After pointing to the great levels of success he earned from the release of his Live. Love. ASAP. mixtape — including a performance on the network’s Video Music Awards — A$AP’s interview returned to more pleasant topics, including fashion and modeling. The rapper also talked briefly about his friendship with rapper Schoolboy Q.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5ausXnRqJqksV2prq230maYm6elqXqptdJmoKeenKqyr6%2FEZp%2BiqF2dvLF5kG1oa2hjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-of-the-most-expensive-hotel-rooms-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>10 Of The Most Expensive Hotel Rooms In The World</span></a>
