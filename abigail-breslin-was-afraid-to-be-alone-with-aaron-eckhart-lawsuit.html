Per the lawsuit, the “entire production almost ground to a halt” following her claims.</p><p class=p1>Breslin accused Eckhart of displaying “aggressive, demeaning, and unprofessional behavior,” insisting that his actions “placed her at various times in peril,” in a letter she sent to the <a href=#>SAG-AFTRA union</a>. She allegedly set “forth her fears and [blasted]” Eckhart’s behavior.</p><p class=p1>Breslin allegedly would only continue filming so long as she did not have any scenes “alone” with Eckhart. “Costly accommodations had to be made by the production to accommodate Breslin’s demands or else [she] would not continue to perform her contractual obligations,” the court documents read.</p><p class=p1>The lawsuit also revealed that a producer complied with <a href=#>SAG-AFTRA guidelines</a> for a “safe set” and conducted an investigation. No evidence of any wrongdoing on Eckhart’s part was found, with the docs calling Breslin’s claims “wild, hysterical and imaginary.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abigail-Breslin-Was-Afraid-to-Be-Alone-With-Aaron-Eckhart-3.jpg><p class=p1>Eckhart has not publicly responded to Breslin’s claims. <i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out to both actors for comment. Breslin’s rep told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Rolling Stone </i></a>in a statement that the <i>Little Miss Sunshine </i>actress is “not aware of any action filed against her” nor has she been “served with any legal notice.”</p><p class=p1>Her spokesperson added: “Ms. Breslin categorically denies all contended allegations and unequivocally stands by her statement, which she provided confidentially to SAG.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Classified </i>is an action-packed thriller directed by <strong>Roel Reine</strong>, following a CIA operative (Eckhart) as he reunites with his long-lost daughter (Breslin), who’s been working as an M16 analyst in the U.K., to debunk a hoax about his death. <strong>Tim Roth</strong> also stars in the drama, which was written by <strong>Bob DeRosa</strong>. Principal production was completed in Malta in spring.</p><p class=p1><i>Classified </i>wrapped in May and <a href=#>marked the second time</a> that Breslin and Eckhart worked together. They previously costarred in 2007’s <i>No Reservations, </i>opposite <a href=#><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></a>, when Breslin was 10 years old. (<i>No Reservations </i>was a rom-com set in the culinary world between rival chefs and, at the same time, Zeta-Jones’ Kate recently got custody of her young niece, Zoe.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaampmcrqq4jJupnqucnrtuw8CsZJqeopa2pXnTqGSbnV2WubC6xGauoqyYYq6ivs6nZJ6bm52us8CMpZiwq6WewXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./18-rich-mom-fashion-finds-to-channel-lily-van-der-woodsen.html><span>←</span><span>18 Rich Mom Fashion Finds to Channel Lily van der Woodsen</span></a>
