She went on to win more hearts with her performances in a number of blockbuster rom-com movies. <a href=#>Fans say she has a magic touch, which is why she's been so successful</a>, and it may just be true. Even though she stepped away from romantic movies for more than 2 decades, she remains the most popular actress in the style. But rom-coms aren't the only thing she's done.</p><h2 id=roberts-has-chosen-to-work-in-many-genres>Roberts Has Chosen To Work In Many Genres</h2><p>Refusing to allow herself to be boxed into only one category, Roberts has played a wide variety of roles and her work has been recognized. Along the way, she’s become one of the most respected actors of her generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her career, she has received 4 Academy Award nominations, winning the coveted statuette once, for her work in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2000 film, Erin Brockovich</a>.</p><p>Based on the true story of a mother who won a battle against corporate environmental offenders, the film showed a totally different side of the actress who had made a name for herself in lighter films. It also marked a huge step in her value.</p><p>Roberts was paid $20 million, becoming the highest-paid actress in Hollywood at the time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Julia Roberts Was The First Woman To Make Over $20 Million For This Role</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taking even skeptical critics by surprise, Erin Brockovich</a> is considered Robert’s best work, but it’s not the only time her skill has impressed them.</p><h2 id=she-has-been-impressive-in-her-serious-roles>She Has Been Impressive In Her Serious Roles</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roberts' Emmy-nominated performance in </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Normal Heart</a>, the 2014 HBO drama about the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, made the critics sit up and take notice of her again.

While her more serious performances have won her critical acclaim, they aren’t the biggest successes she's enjoyed at the box office. <a href=#>Her most popular movies are still firmly rooted within the rom-com genre</a>.</p><p>While many may disparage the style, there is a place for lighter work among audiences, and her successes have been astounding. Among her top 10 highest-grossing movies are Notting Hill, Runaway Bride, My Best Friend’s Wedding, and Valentine’s Day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Erin Brockovich only comes in at eighth position on the list, behind heist movies Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve.</p><h2 id=pretty-woman-is-at-the-top-of-the-pile>Pretty Woman Is At The Top Of The Pile</h2><p>Robert’s biggest hit was billed as an unconventional love story. The film stars Roberts as a sex worker and Richard Gere as a businessman, and three decades later, it is still one of the most popular rom-coms of all time.</p><p>The 1990 movie has raked in an astounding $463.4M at the box office.
