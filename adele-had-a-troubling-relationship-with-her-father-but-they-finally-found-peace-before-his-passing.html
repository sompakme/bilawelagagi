She even reached a point where she didn't want to speak to her father again after he sold information about her to a tabloid. Adele has also stated that her relationship with her father has affected her relationships. However, when she learned her father was sick, she went right to his side. Adele and her father finally found peace before his passing, despite the troubling relationship she'd had with him.</p><h2 id=adele-had-a-troubling-relationship-with-her-father>Adele Had A Troubling Relationship With Her Father</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar51164225.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Some celebrities prefer to keep their personal life private</a>, mostly hidden from the public view. Some celebrities are even well-known for being secretive when it comes to their personal lives, especially their personal relationships.</p><p>Adele is one celebrity who doesn't prefer to discuss her personal life often in public, and would rather discuss her work. However, the Set Fire to the Rain singer has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed her troubling relationship with her father</a> on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.</p><p>According to Yahoo! Sports, the actor said in the interview she felt "let down by her father", an alcoholic who would leave his family. Adele stated "she definitely had a yearning for him, because he didn't really deliver for me."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Adele's Life Was Like Before Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing, the Hello singer revealed, "I didn't really have his attention, he'd say he would come and then he didn't, and if he did come, we'd only go out for like half an hour and then he'd drop me home."</p><p>Commenting on her father's absence from her life, Adele said, "He had a disease, he was a really big alcoholic and he had loads of demons, but I didn't really understand that when I was younger."</p><h2 id=adele-and-her-father-finally-found-peace-before-his-passing>Adele And Her Father Finally Found Peace Before His Passing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar51166537-1.jpg><p>It seems some celebrities who were formerly close, and even some celebrities' family members who've been feuding, <a href=#>might always have a chance for a reconciliation</a>. Even if it might come when the end for a good friend or family member is close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, it seems some celebrities are unable to resolve their differences, even if the disagreement might have started out over something small, or was a misunderstanding which escalated into something bigger.</p><p>Of course, this can happen with celebrities' loved ones as well as other celebrities they might be asked to work with. Before Adele's father passed away, the Easy on Me singer made peace with him, even though the two had had a troubled relationship.</p><p>When Adele found out her father was sick, she rushed straight to his side. It seems when she got the news, what had happened in the past didn't seem as important to hold onto. She also began to understand at an older age that her father hadn't been well.</p><p>According to the Mirror, she was able to make peace with her father, stating, "I made the peace with him when I found out he was sick. And we really got on, which was amazing, but also sad because he was really funny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added, "He is really funny and I don't remember that when I was little. We laughed and we gossiped and we cried. It was great for both of us."</p><p>According to smoothradio.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele revealed that she finally felt closure after visiting her dad</a>. Adele's father Mark Evans, passed away from bowel cancer in May 2021.</p><p>"My dad's absolute lack of presence and effort...But I finally understood that it was the alcohol...

Tensions can rise for several reasons within a family, and some celebrities have argued or feuded publicly with family members. <a href=#>Other celebrities are able to work though things amicably</a>, even without arguing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, if a celebrity's family member is going through a rough time, or is suddenly diagnosed with an unexpected illness, even family members who haven't spoken in years might come together in order to reconcile their differences.</p><p>According to the Mirror, when the Skyfall singer found out her father Mark Evans was sick, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she went to be with him immediately</a>. Adele said, "When I found out that he was ill a few years ago, I got the call and I drove straight there."</p><p>Adele added, "It was hard but it was definitely one of the biggest moments of my life in a good way, when I went to go and see him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sad Story Of Adele And Her Father</a></span></p><p>During a Zoom call the two had in 2021, Adele played her dad songs from her 30 album.

I felt that huge gaping hole filled"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was one song, To Be Loved, that she seemed to really want her father to hear from the album. "The song explores how her dad's absence affected her ability to trust."</p><p>Adele added, "It was amazing for me and him. I think he could listen to me sing it, but not saying it - we are very similar like that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZ2cmnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMsKCtoF2dsrN5xZqroZ2iYq%2Bmss6rnGagmah6pbHArZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-singer-alessia-cara-parents-meet-mom-enza-and-dad-vincenzo-caracciolo-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Singer Alessia Cara Parents?
