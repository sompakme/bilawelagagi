Drake and I have been talking for years and have mutual crushes on each other!,” she posted.</p><p>She continued her flip-flopper love note. “Drake Is Not The One For Me, But I’m Sure He’ll Make Someone Happy!,” she allegedly wrote before reverting back to her original thoughts on the rapper, “Drake Is Ugly.”</p><p>While those characters appear to have evaporated from her timeline, the She’s The Man star did explain her other obsession: <a href=# id=auto-tag_plastic-surgery_3 data-tag=plastic-surgery>plastic surgery</a>.” I Need To Have Surgery To Look Beautiful For The Man I’m In Love With,” she writes, “So I Feel Comfortable With The Way I Look When We Get Married.”</p><p>Bynes even channels Ghandi, saying, “You Have To Make A Change To See A Change.”</p><p>Photo Credit: Twitter/ Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a6orrDmmSbsZ6awG7A1p6cratdmb%2Bit8Rmp6WZo6m2pHnSrqmgnaKuenKClHFtcmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-times-famous-people-blamed-hackers-on-their-social-media-gaffes.html><span>←</span><span>15 Times Famous People Blamed Hackers On Their Social Media Gaffes</span></a>
