Retelling a story in which she came between veteran newswoman Couric and her new husband, John Molner, Schumer held nothing back to share how she jokingly asked for sex from Molner.</p><p>Seated together at the 2015 Glamour Women of the Year Awards in London last month, the Trainwreck actress, 34, found Couric, 58, to be a big fan of her comedy, so when the pair struck up a conversation, Schumer decided to show Couric firsthand just how over-the-top her antics can be.</p><p>At one point during the evening, Couric realized that her financier hubby, 51, showed up at the party without an invitation. "Katie is like 'Oh my God. My husband is here. He wasn't invited. This is so embarrassing,'" Schumer told Fallon. When Couric got up from their table to greet her husband across the room, Schumer went in for the kill.</p><p>"She left her phone open to a text from him," Schumer continued of new pal Couric. "I picked it up and, without even thinking, texted him, 'I want to have anal tonight,' and I sent it. I didn't even think about it. It happened so fast!"</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Maybe she should have given it a second thought. "[Katie] and her husband [returned to the table] like, 'So we're leaving. I don't know why… he wants to leave,'" Schumer recounted.</p><p>Couric and Molner married in an intimate family-only ceremony in the backyard of her Hamptons, N.Y., home in June 2014. She has two adult daughters, Ellie and Carrie, from her marriage to the late Jay Monahan, and helps raise her new husband's children Allie and Henry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapaliwKS01Kacq2WkmsW1scNmopqsmZp6pLvUq6Ccq12dwrSuwKebZqyfYrGwecCnmKVlpKS7qrPHrWRraGFqfneDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jwoww-tanning-for-big-dollars.html><span>←</span><span> Jwoww -- Tanning for BIG Dollars</span></a>
