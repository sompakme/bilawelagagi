In photos from the rare public outing, the couple<a href=#> looked thrilled as they enjoyed the sights</a> together.</p><p>Faris has preferred to stay tight-lipped when it comes to her romance with the cinematographer. Before <a href=#>meeting Barrett on set</a>, the Mom alum was married to actor <strong>Ben Indra</strong> from 2004 to 2008. She moved on with <a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a> and the pair exchanged vows in 2009. Faris and Pratt, 43, expanded their family with son Jack three years later before ultimately calling it quits in 2018.</p><p>Faris crossed paths <a href=#>with Barrett later that year while filming Overboard</a> and they started dating. After two years together, the Scary Movie star confirmed in February 2020 that she was engaged to the California native.</p><p>One month prior, Faris’ former costar <a href=#><strong>Allison Janney</strong></a> gushed <a href=#>about the major milestone.</a></p><p>“I know she’s been engaged for a long time. I kept it very quiet, I’ll have you know! So, I celebrated with them a long time ago,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in January 2020. “I didn’t know he was going to propose, but I saw the ring one day. I went into her room to work on lines [for the show], and then I was like, ‘What is that ring on your finger?’ … I think she was waiting for everyone to notice. ‘Oh, that’s it,’ and then … yeah, it was fun.”</p><p>The What’s Your Number star accidentally let it slip in July 2021 <a href=#>that she and Barrett eloped.</a></p><p>“I think we’ve spent the last year in a place of reflection, in a place of kind of prioritization to some degree, a place of anxiety, a place of like, whatever, assessment. But I’m looking around, just so, just my fiancé’s right … he’s now my husband,” Faris shared on an episode of her “Anna Faris is Unqualified” podcast about the private courthouse ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anna-faris-michael-barrett-are-all-smiles-during-rare-outing.jpg><p>She then <a href=#>issued an apology to her husband</a>. “Yes, we eloped … I’m sorry. I didn’t know … I’m sorry, honey. I just blurted that out, but it just feels [like] I can’t say fiancé anymore,” she added, noting that the wedding was “awesome” and “it feels great” to be married again.</p><p>Faris previously used her podcast to reflect on <a href=#>the ups and downs in her past relationships</a>. “My two other marriages were with actors and I don’t think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness,” she admitted in a March 2021 episode. “Or at least I didn’t, being a proud person and not wanting to reveal vulnerability.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Two months later, Faris recalled not being honest about her personal life and <a href=#>how it affected her at the time</a>. “For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn’t have,” she detailed on another episode of her show, noting that those experiences “stunted” her in “a lot of ways.”</p><p>The House Bunny star continued: “One of them being that I never talked about any issues, so to the people, even who I was closest to, I’m sure things were more transparent with my relationship with [first husband] Ben, but with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6Weqet0aKqZqWZmLWisctmmZqqoprBtXnAq5xmmZyherS5yKWcrGWUqr%2BqusZmqZqqlWK8tsDIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-mythological-creatures-that-might-actually-be-real.html><span>←</span><span>15 Mythological Creatures That Might Actually Be Real</span></a>
