This success has landed him a variety of different roles in both series and cinematic films, such as American Sniper, Thor, American Hustle, and more recently, A Star Is Born, where he cast alongside other big names such as Lady Gaga.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having firmly established himself within in industry, Cooper has also found himself dating some pretty high profile women. Between 2006 and 2007, he dated American actress Jennifer Esposito. Other women that he has dated include Renée Zellweger, Jennifer Lopez, Zoe Zaldana, Suki Waterhouse and more recently Huma Abedin, although speculation is in the air as to wether they are still together. This is because he was recently spotted on vacation with his ex-girlfriend Irina Shayk, leaving puzzled fans questioning his relationship status.</p><h2 id=how-did-bradley-and-irina-meet>How Did Bradley And Irina Meet?</h2><p>While they are reportedly now no longer together, Bradley and Irina seemingly had quite a successful relationship together, dating for a total of four years and even bringing a baby into the world together.</p><p>No official source has confirmed exactly how the pair met, however, it was rumored (emphasize rumored) that his 'team <a href=# rel=noreferrer>brought him a stack of headshots of single women</a>' that were 'willing and able to date him'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this remains a rumor and has never been confirmed. This has led some fans to speculate that they perhaps met through a mutual friend or mutual connection, or perhaps even got set up together. Either way, it was all certainly kept very hush-hush.</p><p>The pair were first spotted together on April 22nd of 2015 in New York, after attending the Broadway show Finding Neverland together. Just a month later, they were then spotted kissing, which officially confirmed any romance rumors that had been floating around.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Who Is Gloria Campano, Bradley Cooper's Mom?">Who Is Gloria Campano, Bradley Cooper's Mom?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was very clear that the two were officially together at this point. Over the course of the rest of the year, they were spotted together on several romantic occasions.</p><p>From this point onwards, it seemed as though their relationship was going from strength to strength. Irina was even snapped out in public with Bradley's mom, another sign that things were getting pretty serious.</p><h2 id=shayk-and-cooper-share-one-child>Shayk And Cooper Share One Child</h2><p>After just a year together, the love-struck couple announced that they were expecting a baby together in 2016. Their bundle of joy officially joined the world in 2017, and <a href=#>the couple even revealed that they had named her after a family member</a>.</p><p>The name Lea De Seine Shayk Cooper was in fact inspired by Irina's grandmother, and Irina references her as "one of the strongest women in my life".</p><p>However, despite the couple no longer being together, <a href=#>Irina has spoken about her dislike of the term co-parenting</a> when it comes to the upbringing of her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="These Celebrities Want To Be Bradley Cooper's Next Girlfriend">These Celebrities Want To Be Bradley Cooper's Next Girlfriend</a></span></p><p><a href=#>She has also revealed what it has been like being a single mom</a>. In an interview with British Vogue, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she opened up about her struggles</a>, stating, "It’s hard to find a balance between being a single mom and being a working woman and provider."</p><p>This suggests that after the couple split in 2019, Irina may have struggled to adapt to life without Bradley.</p><h2 id=bradley-and-irina-are-co-parenting-for-the-sake-of-their-daughter>Bradley And Irina Are Co-Parenting For The Sake Of Their Daughter</h2><p>Despite splitting in 2019, Bradley and Irina have continued to be very publicly supportive of each other. In December 2021, <a href=#>the pair were spotted together at his film premiere for Nightmare Alley</a>, an event that seemed to put a smile on Bradley's face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, romance rumors have been sparking between the pair once more as the pair posted some adorable Instagram pics together of a recent vacation. The snaps show both Irina and Bradley enjoying themselves at the beach, flashing dazzling smiles toward the camera.</p><p>Despite rumors brewing that the pair may have reconciled, their relationship status is still up in the air.</p><p>One source reportedly told E! News Online that they are not back together, and that "They are co-parenting and get along well for the sake of their daughter. They do things as a family and it's going well." This was reported at the end of August 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did Bradley Cooper Secretly Warn Robert Pattinson About Dating His Ex-Girlfriend?

They have ever been considering having more children together, alongside their now five-year-old daughter who they conceived in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, despite not being officially back together yet, it looks like a rekindling of their former romance could be poised on the horizon.</p><p>However, it seems as though they are both more than happy to co-parent their child together for now, and it is certainly encouraging news that they still appear to be so close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dnr%2BqusBmqqGZqaB6o77AnaOesV2YvLC8xKtkm5mToHq1u8aeq6GdomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-a-listers-who-are-total-jerks-and-2-who-are-low-key-sweethearts.html><span>←</span><span>15 A-Listers Who Are Total Jerks (And 2 Who Are Low-Key Sweethearts)</span></a>
