Ariel Winter was 11 at the start of the show, while Hyland was 18. At a panel appearance back in 2020 at the Television Critics Association, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyland and Winter talked the difficulties of growing in the public eye</a>. Given that their appearances kept changing, it was a constant struggle behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s really difficult to grow up in front of millions of people who have an opinion on everything you do, and who are allowed to say it at any point. “They] think they know you really well, and they think they can comment on everything you wear, everything you do, or how you grow up and change.” Hyland revealed. "People really love to attack women especially."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar49992305.jpg><p>Ariel Winter had a similar experience, but things might've been worse for the actress who was going through puberty at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I especially hated the year I had braces,” Winter recalled. “I do have to say it was a really awkward year for me because I also went through puberty that summer. So it was, like, I had episodes with me in braces. And then over the summer, once we wrapped, I had … other things … and I looked different, but I still wasn’t quite, you know, fully through puberty.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/julie-bowen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Julie Bowen's Health Issues Make Filming Modern Family More Complicated Than It Needed To Be?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Modern Family star Julie Bowen faced health problems behind the scenes.</span><p>The pair had a couple of ways to cope. For one, they turned to one another. Secondly, they weren't afraid to clap back at those that had an opinion about their appearance.</p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-ariel-winter-leaned-on-each-other-during-the-tough-times>Sarah Hyland And Ariel Winter Leaned On Each Other During The Tough Times</h2><p>Sarah Hyland is proud of the way she was able to handle all the "hate" along the way. She's especially proud of how she and Winter were able to get witty with their responses to public opinion.</p><p>“We have great support in each other,” Winter said.</p><p>“It’s made us stronger as we get older.” “I think Ariel is such an amazing woman and has always been so mature and handles it with such grace and poise,” Hyland added. “I think, between the two of us, we really have gone and tackled them with all of our spite and wit.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50162850.jpg><p>As for Winter, she revealed that the experience only made her stronger, developing a "thicker skin."</p><p>“It’s still going to bother me. It’s never going to go away,” Winter said. “You’re still human, but you just have to remember these people online and what they’re saying, it’s not your opinion of yourself.”</p><p>She continues, “I’ve responded to it in so many different ways.

According to her words with Yahoo Entertainment, that's what Sarah Hyland faced, going through a kidney disease at the time of the show. The pain got so bad for Hyland, that she forgot about filming certain episodes.</p><p>"There are some episodes of Modern Family where I do not remember filming because I was asleep," she said. "Dead ass asleep. The episode where Haley asked [Luke for] money and he's like, 'Don't worry, I've got it on ice.' It's in the freezer or something. The entire episode I was asleep," referring to Oct. 2011's "Hit and Run."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52347703.jpg><p>"You have to be a certain level of sick in order to receive a transplant. I was reaching that certain level of sick," she said prior to her first transplant. "I was not able to be awake for eight hours at a time. I was so exhausted. So I'd be on the set, I'd be dead asleep, my head on the table, I would hear, 'and...'" before "action" — the cue taping was to begin — and her head would shoot up and she'd deliver her lines. When they cut, she'd fall back asleep."</p><p>A tough time for Hyland.
