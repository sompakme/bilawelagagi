She was eliminated during the third week but revealed that she shares a daughter, Blakely, with her ex-husband <strong>Blake Dennis</strong>.</p><p>Brayden, for his part, caused controversy on <strong>Charity Lawson</strong>’s season 20 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, which came to an end in April. He self-eliminated during the fourth week of the season.</p><p>Following his brief Bachelorette journey, Brayden headed to Mexico for a second shot at love. He made an immediate connection with <strong>Kat Izzo</strong> (Zach’s season) when season 9 premiered in September, but their flame ultimately fizzled out.</p><p>“I don’t do well with dating multiple people at once. And I think that that was one of the things that was hard about Paradise — the aspect of dating multiple people at once, because it’s just, like, how do you truly get to know someone when you’re getting to know five other people?” Brayden <a href=#>admitted to Us</a> in October. “And so for me, it was like, ‘I liked Kat. I knew I liked her.’ I knew I had a connection and I was going to ride that road until it ended … or until it ends.”</p><p>As Kat decided to also explore other relationships, Brayden moved on with former Bachelorette<strong> Rachel Recchia</strong> — until <strong>Becca Serrano</strong> (Zach’s season) arrived in Paradise. He cut things off with Rachel to explore a possible relationship with Becca.</p><p>“I know that Paradise is really open and doesn’t have rules, but for me, I have my own rules and I think that’s kind of more so just what I followed,” Brayden told Us. “I can’t hold other people to that, but that’s what I hold myself to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the end, both Becca and Rachel <a href=#>self-eliminated</a>, which meant Brayden wasn’t offered a rose and was sent home.</p><p>Before kicking off his connection with Christina, Brayden said Paradise was full of “hot and sweaty rose ceremonies,” telling Us that his journey on the show was “a wild ride.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmiqF2osqK%2FzqdkcmWWnruiuMRmmauZqZmyr3nBqK6eqqNitrR5w5qroqaXYrCpvsisq6KmkWK6orrDq5ylpF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-devondre-trevon-phillips-las-vegas-man-sentenced-to-29-years-in-mass-shooting-at-st-paul-b.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Devondre Trevon Phillips?
