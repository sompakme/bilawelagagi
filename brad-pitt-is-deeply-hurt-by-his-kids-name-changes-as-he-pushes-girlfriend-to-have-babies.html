To him, it was more than a change of name — it was a symbol of a deeper estrangement that has been brewing for years,” they told Us Weekly.</p><p>“Sadly, Brad doesn’t have much of a relationship with his kids. He’s not ready to give up on them, but knowing they are dropping his name is upsetting,” another insider said, noting Angelina has allegedly gotten in the way of Brad reconciling with his children following their shocking divorce.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/these-angelina-jolie-movies-have-grossed-over-100-million-at-the-box-office-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="These Angelina Jolie Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office">These Angelina Jolie Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Angelina Jolie has captivated audiences with her talent and beauty since the 1980s, it's no wonder she stars in a huge list of profitable films.</p><p>“They’ve struggled to forgive and connect with Brad since the divorce,” they continued. “Their mom is the head of the household, and she’s raised them with love and selflessness their whole lives.

Last fall, her older sister Zahara made headlines when she was introduced only by her mom’s surname at a college event, leading to rumors that she’s completely estranged from Brad, who has faced allegations of abuse from Angelina as the two continue to battle for custody of their youngest minor children.</p><h2 id=brad-reportedly-wants-kids-with-ines-de-ramon>Brad Reportedly Wants Kids With Ines De Ramon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/brad-pitt-and-ines-de-ramon.jpeg><p>While Brad may feel disappointed by the state of his relationship with his children, reports suggest he’s thinking of expanding his family with his girlfriend, Ines de Ramon.</p><p>"Brad wants another chance at fatherhood," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a source told In Touch</a>. "He's a different person than the first time around." Reports from earlier this year echoed a similar sentiment, <a href=#>saying Pitt is eager to start planning a family</a> with Ines after her <a href=#>divorce from Vampire Diaries star Paul Wesley was finalized</a>, following several years in court – a situation Brad can likely relate to, as he’s still at war with Jolie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same insider said that Brad believes Angelina influenced Shiloh’s decision to change her last name, and he apparently thinks the Maleficent star will continue to drive a wedge between him and their kids.</p><p>"Given the cold climate between him and Shiloh's mother, he suspects Angelina had a hand in this," the source shared.</p><p>"The days after Shiloh's birth in Namibia were some of the happiest days in Brad's life," the they continued, adding Brad’s other youngest daughter, Vivienne, has also dropped his last name. "He's deeply hurt and is also troubled that Vivienne and Zahara stopped using his name. It's clear Angelina is twisting the knife."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUYr2qwNNmm56doKHGbrTUq6tmo5mZwG66wKacZpuYlruosdJmp66rmJrAbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V5x5qtnmWSlq%2BqsdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blake-lively-s-white-airport-outfit-shop-the-look-for-less.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Livelys White Airport Outfit: Shop the Look for Less</span></a>
