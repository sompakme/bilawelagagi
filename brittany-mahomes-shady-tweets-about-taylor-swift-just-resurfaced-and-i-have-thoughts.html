Swifties are keeping a close watch on this situation, hoping it's all good vibes between them, but her recent collaboration with Kim Kardashian has made us even more skeptical. But hey, only time will tell, right? As for me, I'm staying cautiously optimistic while crossing my fingers for Taylor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brittany-mahomes-39-old-tweets-about-taylor-swift-are-surprisingly-aggressive>Brittany Mahomes' Old Tweets About Taylor Swift Are Surprisingly Aggressive</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-at-coachella.jpg><p>For fans who maybe haven't heard yet, <strong>Brittany Mahomes' old tweets resurfaced after she seemed to strike up a fast friendship with Taylor Swift</strong>, and they weren't very kind. Lots of swifties, myself included, were surprised and hurt to see<strong> how vicious her words were</strong>, especially considering that the NFL wife didn't know Taylor at the time.</p><p>For reference, the first tweet where she complains about Taylor Swift "winning everything", Brittany wrote it after the pop star had a triumphant night at the American Music Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Taylor swift... I wanna know when your gonna find something different to write about besides boys and relationships... #timeforsomethingnew," she wrote in 2012, which was (and still is) a common attack against her. This leads me to believe that <strong>she hadn't really listened much to her music back then</strong>, because anyone who actually pays attention to her music will know her songwriting range.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:19</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-s-relationship-with-travis-kelce-is-drastically-different-from-her-past-famous-romances-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There are a lot of unique things about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's fascinating relationship.</span><p>To be fair, Brittany Mahomes, at the time, was an 18-year-old girl, and probably everyone will agree that none of us behave or think the same way as we did when we were teenagers. She probably never imagined that, ten years later, her husband's best friend would be dating the pop star she had spent a lot of time bashing in her teens.</p><p>Still, it's not only her past behavior that's concerning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-taylor-and-brittany-39-s-friendship-genuine>Is Taylor And Brittany's Friendship Genuine?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-brittany-mahomes.jpg><p>Recently, I've had some doubts about the nature of the newfound friendship between Taylor and Brittany. If it was just the tweets, it would be one thing, but we should also keep in mind <strong>Brittany Mahomes' recent collaboration with Kim Kardashian's brand, SKIMS,</strong> which sources have said really hurt Taylor Swift.</p><p>We know from The Tortured Poets Department that <a href=#>Taylor is not over the damage the feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West</a> caused her, and with good reason, so having an alleged friend work closely with someone who caused her pain can't be easy for her. <strong>"It truly showed how loyal she is to her friends. And Brittany chose money over friendship, which says a lot," </strong>a source said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you ask me, it seems Brittany might be taking advantage of her closeness to Taylor Swift. I have no way of knowing if she spoke to her and apologized for her tweets, so I might be wrong, but insiders seem to agree with me.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sources have stated that</a> she's <strong>"acting like Taylor's BFF"</strong> because she <strong>"is desperate to be known"</strong> as more than <strong>"a trophy wife to an NFL star."</strong> The source also said that Brittany has been making an effort <strong>"to insert herself into Swift's circle"</strong> and I think she might go from "Patrick Mahomes' wife" to "Taylor's friend."</p><p>Another source added, "She has wanted to be relevant for so long and finally found her in." They also added that her work with Kim Kardashian was a "betrayal," and is "an opportunist who is clearly not a girl's girl."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift's public interactions with Brittany Mahomes seem limited to when the two of them are cheering on their husbands during a match, so the pop star probably knows to keep her distance from people she doesn't know if she can fully trust.</p><p>Only time will tell how genuine the relationship truly is. I can't say I buy into the fast friendship Brittany is trying to portray, but as a swiftie, I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. After all, I wouldn't want to have to justify the comments I made when I was 18 for the rest of my life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gkqa6vxYymmKGnnZrAbrnEmqVmrKeasrW%2FjK2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2aqlajCs7LAnJydZZ%2Bltq%2B1zqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-down-ed-sheeran-s-reported-200-million-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Breaking Down Ed Sheeran's Reported $200 Million Net Worth</span></a>
