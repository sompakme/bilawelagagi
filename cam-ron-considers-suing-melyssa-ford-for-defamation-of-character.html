He addressed the former video vixen for suggesting he and <a href=# id=auto-tag_mae data-tag=mae>Ma$e</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>may have slept with underage girls</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“First of all, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>we only like older [women]</a>; second of all, it was 1992, and we were underage. That’s A and B. We wasn’t supposed to be in there. We wasn’t 18, I had just turned 16. I ain’t even defending myself on that nonsense. You not even from this country so I don’t know what the f**k going on in the wh**ehouses in Canada. Whatever pedophile sh*t they on where you from, we not on that. The moral of the story, she said it, knowing the times we are in. Joe Budden and them went in on her or whatever like, ‘Thats some serious allegations.’ But, they didn’t edit it out. So they either threw her under the bus or they said, ‘F**k it, let’s get the ratings.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cam then made his own accusations about Ford. The Dipset rapper alleged that the former model slept with Ice-T for money in a bathroom. “I could’ve went straight to, Ice-T f**ked you in the bathroom for $2,000 when you was doing waitressing. I didn’t even go there! You used to f**k in the bathroom at the Kit Kat Club or one of them old-a** clubs. Stop, you a video vixen!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As he continued his IG Live, Cam then got at <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-joe-budden-podcast data-tag=the-joe-budden-podcast>The Joe Budden Podcast</a> for keeping Ford’s comments in the final edit. He weighed his options of taking the matter to court to rectify the situation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cam'ron goes OFF on IG live addressing the entire Joe Budden Podcast cast after Melyssa Ford alleged him & Mase were with underaged girls in a wh*rehouse</p><p>he's thinking about suing them for defamation</p><p>"you could've deleted it.. shout out to Joe Buddens for hiring all these… <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/BMmFFkykXP</a></p>— SOUND (@itsavibe) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 7, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was going to leave it alone but then she said ‘sorry’, which the sorry wasn’t even genuine. That sh*t was fake,” Cam’ron added. “I don’t know who even convinced her to do the sh*t. But whoever did that was smart ’cause now if I sue ni**as for defamation of character, I’m a sucker, right…Now if I sue y’all ni**as for defamation of character, I’m a sucker. Well, I might be a sucker, I just might be. I don’t know yet. I’m thinking about it, pause.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cam’ron and Melyssa Ford’s drama stemmed from the <a href=# id=auto-tag_it-is-what-it-is data-tag=it-is-what-it-is>It Is What It Is</a> team <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recalling a visit to a brothel</a>. Ma$e and Cam detailed the visit and what went down. The Joe Budden Podcast covered the topic on their show. Ford suggested that some of the women Cam and Ma$e had sexual relations with were minors at the time.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Is there a distinct possibility that there may have been underage girls in that whorehouse?” she asked. Ford then issued a public apology to the duo, deeming her assertion as inexcusable. “I should never have made that insinuation,” she said on a subsequent episode of The&nbsp;Joe Budden Podcast.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurr7Op2SsrZmjtG65xKWwrKuRYrOwvsNmm56ekaKutbXOp2Sonl2YtaK%2BwJyrnqpdZn90gJdrcHBvYWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adam-ant-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Adam Ant Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
