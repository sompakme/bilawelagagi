The co-creator of the game, <strong>Max Temkin</strong>, decided to pull a Black Friday prank, selling customers actual poop labeled “Bulls—t.”</p><p>Charging customers $6 for a box of pasteurized bull feces, Temkin told <a href=#>Time Magazine </a>that the product sold out in less than two hours. It’s a part of Temkin’s crusade against the consumerist phenomenon that Black Friday has become.&nbsp;</p><p>“We all really hate Black Friday, it’s just kind of a horrible day,” he told Time. “It comes after this day where you’re supposed to be thankful for what you have, and then it’s just this whole huge media spectacle of people fighting each other to save $50 on a TV.”</p><p>For last year's Black Friday prank, the game upped its retail price to $5 higher than normal, and this year they wanted to go even bigger.&nbsp;</p><p>“We also had the idea of issuing people a one-penny-off coupon, but that felt weird because it was still a deal,” he continued. “That’s sort of still doing Black Friday.”</p><p><strong>(See the NSFW video below of a man opening his very own "Bulls–t.")</strong></p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The poop comes from a cattle ranch in Texas, and the company labeled its boxes to say “Box made in China. Poop made in America.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s sent, it’s out, it’s done… Initially we got a dozen people who were really surprised it was poop, but it was just actual poop,” Temkin said. Several buyers speculated that there might be a hidden message inside of the nugget, but alas, sometimes bulls—t is just bulls—t.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKZwG6txpqgp6ukYrW2ucCnoK2xXai8rbCMqaaoqF2XuaKvymadq6GUlsZufo9qa2puYWd8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexis-bledel-bikini-body-star-vacations-with-fiance-vincent-kartheiser.html><span>←</span><span>Alexis Bledel Bikini Body: Star Vacations With Fiance Vincent Kartheiser</span></a>
