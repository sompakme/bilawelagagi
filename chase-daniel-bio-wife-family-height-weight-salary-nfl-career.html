class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>William Chase Daniel was born on October 7, 1986 in Irving, Texas.&nbsp;He attended Caroll High School in Southlake where his journey into basketball could be traced.&nbsp;The child was groomed and coached by Todd Dodge, who was a football player and later a coach.&nbsp;The team won the 2002 5A Division II State title, placed 2nd in the state competition in 2003, and won the 2004 5A Division II State Trophy.&nbsp;Daniel played two seasons as a starting quarterback and logged 65.2% of his passes for 8,298 yards with 91 touchdowns, 2,954 rushing yards and 39 points.&nbsp;Chase Daniel finished his high school football career with honors when his school was ranked #1 for high school collegiate football teams in 2004.&nbsp;He also won the 5A State Championships,</span></p><p class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>Chase had high hopes for scholarship offers from prestigious schools like Texas, Maryland, Oklahoma State, Stanford, and Texas A&M, but his hopes were dashed when none of his favorite schools recruited him.&nbsp;He later became involved with Missouri College and eagerly began playing as a quarterback on the team.&nbsp;In no time, Chase became a starting quarterback, ousting Brad Smith in 2005.</span></p><p class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>The avid soccer player stuck to his games and hegradually increased his passing and records, which contributed to the overall success of the team.&nbsp;He was named to the First Team All-Academic Big 12 Team.&nbsp;Chased improved his standing on the team as he continued his heroics the following season, throwing for 4,306 yards with a 68.2% win rate and 33 touchdowns.&nbsp;He reported on ESPN Magazine alongside teammate Chase Patton.&nbsp;He saw his team to 10 wins and ranked 19th in AP Polls in his final season and received several accolades including Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week and of the Year (2006, 2007 and 2008), Sports Illustrated All-American Honorable Mention in 2007 with the Maxwell Award 2007, fourth place in the 2007 Heisman Trophy Finalist List and second place in the 2008 Draddy Trophy Quest,</span></p><p><span>Daniel, with his impressive football resume, stated his intention to enter the 2009 NFL draft, but luck was not on his side on draft night as no club interviewed him or even showed interest in picking him as quarterback.</span></p><h2 class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=nfl-career></span><b><span>NFL career</span></b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>He was first drafted as a free agent by the Federal Armed Forces but did not get playing time with the Washington Redskins when he later left for the New Orleans Saints, where he played alongside Drew Brees, whom he is close with and refers to as a brother.&nbsp;Chase got off to a shambolic start with the Saints, failing to break through as a first-choice quarterback.&nbsp;He was included and reinstated throughout the team’s roster to make him a better player.&nbsp;The soccer player continued to fight for playing time with the team until he broke ties with them in 2012.&nbsp;Chase Daniel managed to catch seven passes for 55 yards, but in all 45 games in which he did not start one,</span></p><p class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>Upon his arrival to the Kansas City Chiefs on March 12, 2013, a new chapter in his football career began as he got plenty of playing time with his new team.&nbsp;William got the opportunity to play against his former team – the Washington Redskins.&nbsp;The match ended in victory for him and the Chiefs as they defeated the visitors by a score of 45-10.&nbsp;It was a remarkable match for Chase Daniel as he found an opportunity to start his first regular season in an NFL game.&nbsp;In his 3 years with the Chiefs, he totaled 43 passes for 410-yard passes, 1 touchdown, and one interception in all 10 games from 2 starts.</span></p><p class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>After rekindling his career, the former vacant quarterback left the Chiefs to join the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016.&nbsp;He signed a 3-year contract valued at an estimated $21 million.&nbsp;However, it seemed that the upswing in his Chiefs career was bound to collapse with the Eagles.&nbsp;Not getting enough playing time, Chase Daniel asked to return to the New Orleans Saints after the Philadelphia Eagles signed Nick Foles.&nbsp;This wish was granted and he once again adorned the old gold, black and white colors of the Mercedes-Benz Superdome domicile team.</span></p><p><span>Upon his return to the Chiefs in 2017, Chase signed a one-year contract and played for the team for one season before bowing out to join the Chicago Bears on a two-year contract worth $10 million with a $7 million guarantee dollars to work.</span></p><p><span>His total career stats so far are 51 passes in 78 attempts for 480 yards and 1 touchdown and one interception.</span></p><h2 class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section

despite the few seasons he’s seen on the field.&nbsp;However, he has earned a few million;&nbsp;The talented quarterback is believed to be earning an estimated $2 million annually with a two-year contract with the Chicago Bears, while his net worth is estimated at around $16 million.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-parents-wife></span><strong><span>Family: parents,

University of Missouri before signing on for his NFL draft.&nbsp;However, the two lost touch before meeting again when they met again in April 2011.&nbsp;Their love affair began and Chase proposed to the beautiful Hilary on February 7, 2014 for a secret dinner that he carefully arranged for the two families.&nbsp;She accepted his proposal and they both tied the knot on July 5, 2014 at Jacob’s Well Church.&nbsp;A beautiful reception hosted by the bride’s family at The Urban Event followed, from where they spent their honeymoon at the Jade Mountain Resort in St. Lucia.&nbsp;The union is blessed with a son named Preston who was born on September 2, 2017.</span></p><p class=yiv8947580740ydpf7f81c04MsoNormal><span>Hilary Elaine Mullin’s parents are JamesLenuel and Lenny Mullin II and she has 2
