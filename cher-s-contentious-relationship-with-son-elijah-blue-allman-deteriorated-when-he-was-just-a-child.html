As a result, Cher's love life has always been associated with Bono who she would later <a href=#>fight to get part of his estate</a>.</p><p>What some casual Cher fans may not realize is that <a href=#>Cher also married Greg Allman</a> and the former couple had a son named Elijah Blue Allman. Unfortunately for Cher and Elijah Allman, the mother and son's relationship has been problematic for decades.</p><h2 id=who-is-cher-39-s-son-elijah-blue-allman>Who Is Cher's Son Elijah Blue Allman?</h2><p>In June 1975, Cher's marriage to her former musical partner Sonny Bono officially ended in divorce after they separated the previous year. Cher wouldn't wait long to walk down the aisle as she got married for the second time later in 1975.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gregg-allman-performing-live-in-concert.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like her first husband, the second man Cher married was a famous singer. Known as the lead singer, songwriter, and keyboardist for The Allman Brothers Band, Gregg Allman was the voice and writer behind many of the band's biggest hits.</p><p>The year after Cher and Gregg Allman tied the knot, the couple welcomed a son into the world on July 10, 1976. Given the name Elijah Blue Allman, many people likely assumed that Allman's life was easy given that he had rich and famous parents.</p><p>In some ways, it seems very clear that Allman's life has been defined by his famous parents. After all, just like Gregg Allman and Cher, Allman followed in their footsteps by forming a band that he fronted called Deadsy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Tragic Truth About Cher's 'Invisible Illness'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly for Allman, he went on to have a lot of struggles in his life as an adult. In 2014, Allman spoke to Entertainment Tonight and revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he'd struggled with serious addiction issues</a> since he was alarmingly young in life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cher-s-contentious-relationship-with-son-elijah-blue-allman-deteriorated-when-he-was-just-a-child.jpg><p>According to Allman, he began consuming illegal substances when he was only eleven years old. Allman also revealed that there were times when his abuse of those substances became so out of control that his life could have ended.</p><p>On top of struggling with substance abuse, Allman has also had to cope with health issues as an adult. As Allman has said in the past, he was forced to battle Lyme disease and things got so bad for him that he says he was fighting for his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/elijah-blue-allman-and-matt-pinfield-from-matt-pinfield-s-twitter-account.jpg><p>While there is nothing good about Lyme disease, Allman's health issues actually brought something big into his life. When Allman received Lyme disease treatments in Germany, he met a woman named Marieangela "Angie" King.</p><p>Just like Allman and his parents, King is a musician since she performs as a singer. Allman and King would ultimately get married in 2014.</p><p>After Cher and Gregg Allman got married in 1975, their marriage officially ended in 1979. When Allman and King got married in 2014, they were able to make things last longer than his parents. Sadly, however, Allman and King separated in 2020 and were divorced in 2021. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allman is the one who filed for divorce</a> citing irreconcilable differences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-cher-had-a-difficult-relationship-with-her-son-elijah-blue-allman>Why Cher Had A Difficult Relationship With Her Son, Elijah Blue Allman</h2><p>While Elijah Blue Allman and Marieangela "Angie" King's marriage ultimately wasn't meant to last, it would have a large impact on his life. After all, Allman's decision to get married seemed to have a major effect on his relationship with his famous mother. At the very least, Allman's marriage changed the way the world perceived his relationship with Cher.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Val Kilmer And Cher Had A Close Relationship Most Didn't Even Know About</a></span></p><p>When Allman got married in February 2014, he didn't have a large ceremony with his mother there to celebrate. Instead, Allman and King decided to elope and the nature of his relationship with Cher partially inspired that decision.</p><p>After Allman and King eloped, he spoke to The Daily Mail about why the couple had a small and private ceremony. Allman also spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his relationship with his mother Cher</a>, and it was very clear that they weren't close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Allman, when he and King got engaged, his mother didn't congratulate them in any way. In fact, Allman says that Cher didn't even bother to acknowledge that her son was planning to get married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cher__meryl_streep_once_saved_a_woman_in_distress_latelatelondon-screen_shot-h_2018_0.jpg><p>While speaking to The Daily Mail, Allman explained that his mother ignoring his engagement led to the couple eloping. "I wasn’t going to wait for anyone’s approval and congratulations just like I’ve never waited for any of that my whole life. The way I eloped with my wife is the same way I’ve done everything I’ve ever done. I don’t know any other way and we knew it was the right time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Allman claimed that, unlike Cher, his famous father's side of the family was excited for him. "She knows that I’m married, my entire family knows I’m married. Some have congratulated me, some haven’t. My father’s side of the family is very happy for us and is very excited."</p><p>Allman also claimed that he and Cher were not on speaking terms at the time of the interview and that wasn't anything new for them. "It’s like a Mexican standoff but we have a history (of not talking). When I first started my band we went a long time, maybe a couple of years."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>David Letterman Finally Got A Certain A-List Guest On The Late Show After Agreeing To Pay Her $28,000 Hotel Fee</a></span></p><p>According to Allman, he and King were even excluded from Cher's annual Christmas party. As he explained to The Daily Mail, that was very hurtful to him. "I’m a real big Christmas guy. It was just kind of unspoken you know, nothing was formal. We knew [we weren’t welcome]."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also during his interview with The Daily Mail, Allman spoke about always feeling like an outsider in his own family. "I’ve always been the black sheep of my family. The reason being we just have different value systems and we just have a different mentality and that clashes a lot."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cher-chaz-bono-and-sonny-bono.jpg><p>On top of his interview with The Daily, Allman spoke to Entertainment Tonight about his relationship with Cher in 2014. During the resulting conversation, Allman explained that his frosty relationship with his famous mom actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started to go awry when he was still very young</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When you go to boarding school at 7 years old, it's kind of hard to feel like you're not being shunned.
