The 33-year-old then moved onto her lap, giving her only a taste of her imagination, before his backup dancers joined him in dance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That’s me @chrisbrownofficial,” the lucky fan captioned the video of her on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As social media got wind of the clip, many other fans began commenting and praising CB for giving fans what they want.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I don’t know how you didn’t gasp or scream cause I would’ve did something crazier,” one fan commented on the video as another asked, “What did he smell like?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=368136>father-of-three </a>followed up on Instagram praising his Dublin fans for giving him an “AMAZING” show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chris Brown’s European Tour comes about after his 2019 sleeper “Under The Influence” from Indigo (Deluxe) gained a substantial amount of traction on TikTok. With no update on an American leg of the tour, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234687628>the Virginia-native </a>did make it clear following the Super Bowl on Sunday (Feb. 12), that he doesn’t feel welcomed by American media.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“America media AINT FA me,” Brown responded to a fan’s IG comment suggesting that he needs to bless the Super Bowl halftime stage one day. “Rather be where I’m welcomed.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The R&B heartthrob <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234713228>has had a hard time </a>getting back into America’s good graces following a few incidents he had in his past, including physical altercations, run-ins with the law and more. Since then, Chris has been pretty much exiled from larger brand endorsements, attending certain events and even performing for major network shows.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Back in November, the multifaceted entertainer was reportedly <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234713489>scheduled to perform at the 2022 American Music Awards</a> in tribute to the late Michael Jackson. However, he was pulled form the show without explanation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After uploading a snippet on Instagram of what fans were going to see on stage that night, Brown let it be known that the AMAs had canceled him “for reasons unknown.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“U SERIOUS,” wrote the&nbsp;MJ-influenced star wrote&nbsp;in all caps at the time.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He followed up with a comment explaining that his set, “WOULDVE been the ama performance but they cancelled me for reasons unknown.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A few of his musical peers came to his defense, including Jermaine Dupri, Ciara and Kelly Rowland.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“MJ, thank you for the inspiration you’ve given us all!&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234689813>Thriller&nbsp;40th Anniversary</a>,” Ciara shared online before adding, “Chris Brown, you’re a rare breed of this generation. Always fun to rock with you.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ironically, Brown scored the award for&nbsp;<a href=#>2022 Favorite Male R&B Artist&nbsp;</a>that night, in which Kelly praised him for his hard work and talent.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Now Chris Brown is not here tonight, so I’m accepting this award on his behalf,” <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234713050>Rowland bega</a>n as some critics began to vocalize their disdain. “Excuse me, chyle—chill out. And I want to tell him thank you for being an incredible performer. I’ll take this award — bring it to you. I love you. Congratulations. And congratulations to all the nominees in this category.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Under the Influence” Tour </a>continues in London on Valentine’s Day (Feb. 14), before concluding in Paris on March 26.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out Breezy giving his Dublin fan a lap dance above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1s7XSZpmrp6ejeqi11Z6qZqSRpXqlrc2cnGasn2KzorqMnayroZ6cerW71KtkampjaYR0gZJramg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./average-salary-of-wnba-player-earnings-and-hourly-wages.html><span>←</span><span>Average Salary of WNBA Player Earnings and Hourly Wages</span></a>
