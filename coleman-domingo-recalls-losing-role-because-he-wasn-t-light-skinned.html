He also remembered telling his agent at the time, “I can’t take it anymore, I think this is going to kill me.” Since those humbling days of auditioning, Domingo has become an <a href=# data-type=pmc_list_item data-id=1234734415>award-winning “offer-only” actor</a> — meaning he’d only accept roles he doesn’t have to audition for.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I became an actor that was ‘offer-only’ probably sooner than the industry thought I should have,” he said. “But I decided I have a body of work. You can go and look at it, you can ask other directors about me, and you can make me the offer or not.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Over the past years, Domingo has gone on to win an Emmy for Euphoria, and also star in Oscar-nominated films If Beale Street Could Talk and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. He most recently <a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234773419>led Netflix’s Rustin</a> and can currently be seen playing the role of Albert “Mister” Johnson in The Color Purple adaptation in theaters now.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i8rbnAp2Sdp52eu6i7jJummqqUrK6tt4yepKmhopp6s7vLnmSwmaOjwW64yKCfrWWjoLavusSdZGpqY2mFdIKUaWlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clarks-sharon-dolly-slip-ons-give-you-height-without-the-heel.html><span>←</span><span>Clarks Sharon Dolly Slip-Ons Give You Height Without the Heel</span></a>
