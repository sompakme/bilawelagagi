It’s an art form of its own!”</p><p class=p1>Wilson — who <a href=#>released her latest LP</a>,&nbsp;<i>Bell Bottom Country,&nbsp;</i>in October 2022 — is currently traveling across the United States as a special guest on <a href=#><strong>Luke Combs</strong></a>’ headlining tour. While on the road, the <a href=#>CMA Awards</a> winner is keen to bring her A-game to every crowd.</p><p class=p1>“I love perfecting the live versions of my music and being able to form a show to the energy of the city we are in,” she tells&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “It makes each performance unique.”</p><p class=p1>Wilson continues: “Every time I hit that stage, there’s an indescribable feeling that takes over my body.”</p><p class=p1>While the “Hold My Halo” singer — who made <a href=#>her red carpet debut with boyfriend</a> <strong>Devlin “Duck” Hodges</strong> at <a href=#>the ACMs</a> earlier this month — loves&nbsp;putting on live shows, she recently found a second calling as an actress. Wilson <a href=#>made&nbsp;her acting debut</a> on&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Yellowstone</a>&nbsp;</i>season 5.</p><p class=p1>“[<a href=#><strong>Taylor Sheridan</strong></a>] had put a few of my songs in the show and then invited me out to Vegas to play a horse-riding competition, and that’s where I got to meet him,” Wilson<a href=#> told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;last month of landing the role</a> of Abby on the Paramount+ western series. “[We] became buddies and, you know, I knew the friendship would lead to something. I didn’t know it necessarily meant me being in the show.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “He called me last February and he said, ‘I want to&nbsp;create a character&nbsp;specifically for you, and I want you to wear your bell bottoms. I want you to sing your own songs and be yourself but go by a musician named Abby.’”</p><p class=p1>The Louisiana native’s <a href=#>first&nbsp;<i>Yellowstone</i>&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;</a>aired in the season 5 premiere, where her character soon found love with<strong> Ian Bohen</strong>’s Ryan. The first half of season 5 dropped in late 2022 before its midseason finale in January. Airdates for the remaining episodes, including <a href=#>the series finale</a>, have yet to be announced. Show creator Sheridan, 52, for his part, is <a href=#>still hard at work writing the last scripts</a>.</p><p class=p1>“No matter which direction it goes, it’s gonna be incredible because&nbsp;Taylor Sheridan, I mean, he can do no wrong, in my opinion,” Wilson <a href=#>gushed to&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;</i>on May 11. “But yeah. I’m waiting for that call. I’m like, ‘Y’all let me know when to be there and I’ll be there.’”</p><p class=p1>As the “Watermelon Moonshine” artist is hopeful about <a href=#>her return to the Dutton Ranch</a>, music remains her No. 1 focus.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I will never not make songwriting my priority because the songwriting is what has given me all the rest of these opportunities,” Wilson told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in April when asked if she’d pursue acting full-time after her<i>&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;</i>experience.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for an exclusive peek at Wilson’s day on tour:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLDBza2psmWjnruosdFmo5qhnprGbsPIpaqopl2eu7S1w55kmmWUlsZutc1mpLJlnJ6zpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brittany-mahomes-shady-tweets-about-taylor-swift-just-resurfaced-and-i-have-thoughts.html><span>←</span><span>Brittany Mahomes' Shady Tweets About Taylor Swift Just Resurfaced, And I Have Thoughts</span></a>
