Brooke lost the match, but worse than that suffered an ankle injury. As she was being helped out of the ring and taken away from the ringside area, not only was Jade in her face and rubbing salt in the wounds, but the fans were relentless in their verbal treatment of her performance.Likely not making a long stopover in <a href=#>NXT</a>, it will be intriguing to see if Brooke returns after the way the fans booed her and sang, "Na Na Na Na, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye" She's also taken some heat on social media from fans, who, for some reason, have made her a target of their vitriol. It's not clear why she's become the focus of so much negative energy, but she addressed it on Twitter Wednesday when she wrote to fans criticizing her performance. Dana <a href=# rel=noopener>addressed the criticism via Twitter</a>…“Alright I get it, y’all think I suck…. Got it, NOTED, Awesome….. &…..”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We've reached out to comment from Brooke to see if she has any other messages on how this all relates to her future in NXT, but we've yet to receive a response.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dana Brooke Wants 24/7 Title To Become WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=some-are-supporting-brooke>Some Are Supporting Brooke</h2><p>After she made the post, former WWE writer Vince Russo took to Twitter to offer his support. He wrote, "Don't listen to these Ass Clowns. They have no idea what you're up against. Not even knowing you I can tell that you're one of those special people who just try to be the BEST You can be Every Day. There's only ONE Person you have to make Proud---and you are doing that."</p><p>Brooke certainly doesn't deserve to be the focus of social media ire. While not at the top tier in WWE in terms of female competitors, a lot of that has to do with a lack of opportunity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeUlruiecGrpqijlWK%2Fpr%2FPqKWdq12pvG6wyKypnqugmrC1edKhprCmXaPFtXnFmqWsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./camila-alves-mother-meet-f%C3%A1tima-saraiva.html><span>←</span><span>Camila Alves Mother: Meet Ftima Saraiva</span></a>
