The amicable exes have worked together for ages, raised a daughter together, and remain close—business-wise and personally—over a decade after their split. <a href=#>Dany even quit her 'day job' to represent Dwayne</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interesting twist, Dany met and later married Dwayne's personal trainer, who also works for the conglomerate that manages The Rock as well as other equally ripped actors. If it seems a bit awkward, it might have been, at least at first. But now? They're one big happy family—and a lucrative one at that.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-39-s-first-wife-helps-manage-him>Dwayne Johnson's First Wife Helps Manage Him</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dwayne-johnson-dany-garcia-in-an-interview-1.jpg><p>Dwayne Johnson's first wife was Dany Garcia; he's currently married to Lauren Hashian, who he tied the knot with in 2019.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia were married in 1997, worked together for many years, then divorced in 2008. They actually separated in 2007, but their split wasn't finalized until the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dwayne began dating Lauren in 2007 after the two met in 2006 while Johnson was working on The Game Plan. Today, the two share two daughters.</p><p>The timelines might be a bit tricky, but it wasn't an acrimonious divorce; Dany and Dwayne reportedly <a href=#>split after recognizing that their relationship was evolving</a>, and after raising a daughter together.</p><p>Even after their divorce, Dany continued working on Dwayne's team, serving as his global strategic advisor. Garcia runs multiple businesses that oversee various brands, and she also works with other big names like Henry Cavill.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is Dany Garcia The Reason For Henry Cavill's Success?">Is Dany Garcia The Reason For Henry Cavill's Success?</a></span></p><p>Despite her ex moving on rapidly after their split, Dany maintains that their divorce was a positive thing, even if it was painful.</p><p>Yet Dany Garcia isn't just on good terms with her ex-husband; she's also married to his personal trainer, who works for her, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dave-rienzi-works-with-dwayne-johnson-in-the-gym>Dave Rienzi Works With Dwayne Johnson In The Gym</h2><p>Dave Rienzi's name is largely recognized for his connection to Dwayne Johnson, rather than Dwayne's ex-wife. Rienzi is a bodybuilder and the Chief Health & Fitness Brand officer of The Garcia Companies.</p><p>In 2022, Rienzi sat down for an interview with GQ to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discuss Dwayne's regimen for Black Adam</a>. Rienzi, who calls Dwayne Johnson DJ, explained that his client worked out six days a week and ate seven meals a day (including 500 grams of protein) "trying to get the abs on point while getting those quads to really fly out and cap the shoulders."</p><p>There was another person or team who handled Dwayne's supplements, but Dave said he "prescribed" Dwayne his pre-workout formula, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Much Money Did Dwayne Johnson's Ex Dany Garcia Get From Their Divorce?">How Much Money Did Dwayne Johnson's Ex Dany Garcia Get From Their Divorce?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If it sounds like a lot of work to manage Johnson's physique, that's because it is. It takes Dany, Dave, and a larger team to handle his health and fitness regimen plus the acting side of things.</p><p>What's interesting is that Dany and Dave are now a husband-wife team managing Dany's ex, and it seems to have worked out well for everyone.</p><h2 id=how-did-dany-garcia-meet-her-spouse-dave-rienzi>How Did Dany Garcia Meet Her Spouse Dave Rienzi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dave-rienzi-and-dwayne-johnson-in-the-gym.jpg><p>The Rock's team might be very well united today, but it didn't start out that way. Apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dany met her ex's trainer through him</a>, while they were all working out together. It's unclear whether Dwayne intended to set them up, or if things unfolded more naturally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rienzi had been Johnson's trainer for years already by the time he met and began dating Garcia. It's not clear when the two first met, though it can be assumed it was early on in Dwayne's relationship with his trainer.</p><p>Given the statements both Dany and Dwayne have made regarding the dissolution of their marriage, it's safe to say that Dwayne was happy for his ex when she found love again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Dwayne Johnson's Team Turned Down The Flash Because They Didn't Want To See The Actor In A Cameo Role">Dwayne Johnson's Team Turned Down The Flash Because They Didn't Want To See The Actor In A Cameo Role</a></span></p><p>Of their split, and the involvement of their respective partners in what is truly a family business, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garcia once noted that her husband is "very confident and calm,"</a> despite his close relationship with his now-wife's ex.</p><p>He was never perturbed by who was my former husband. That means nothing to him. He's about the quality of the person. There's a tremendous amount of respect. When people say: 'How do you do it all?' It comes down to respect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dany elaborated that she and Dwayne never even argue, explaining "We took the time to clean up the areas we weren't communicating in the right way. We took a year after our divorce to really clean up."</p><p>Garcia didn't mention that Johnson was in a relatively new relationship during that time, nor does she speak about when she and Dave began dating. Rienzi and Garcia were married in 2014, but even Dany's Wikipedia page doesn't include a timeline that specifies when they became an item.</p><p>Not that it matters now, anyway. Both Dwayne and Dany appear happy in their respective relationships, and they're still building an empire together despite their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBusMCnsGafkaewqq2MrKeoraOaeqKy056pZqyYmnqzu8KkZJ2hpqS%2FpLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chrystale-wilson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Chrystale Wilson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
