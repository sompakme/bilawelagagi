Many children who watched The Lion King cite it as one of the "most devastating moments of their childhood." With Mufasa being thrown from a cliff and trampled by wildebeests and Scar being mauled by hyenas, this animated film is one of the darkest of Disney's animated films.</p><p>While many claim the original Lion King ending was a lot darker than the one we all know, Scar's death in the final cut of Lion King could actually be seen as worse and more violent.</p><p>In the following, we take a closer look at The Lion King original ending and how it actually ends. We discuss why Disney scrapped the original ending and which version is darker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lion-king-39-s-original-planned-ending-vs-how-lion-king-actually-ends>Lion King's Original Planned Ending Vs.

The scene begins the same with Simba and Scar battling it out ontop of a burning Pride Rock. Instead of Simba safely winning the battle, this other ending has Simba dangerously close to falling from the ledge. His position mimics his father's death before he falls off the rock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Scar mutters "Goodnight, sweet prince," a direct reference to Shakespeare’s Hamlet,</strong> as he launches him from the rock. He and the audience think he has won, and Simba has plummeted to his death. But Simba is clinging to a branch and survives. Scar is so busy celebrating his win that he doesn’t notice the rising flames, which take his life in the original Lion King ending.</p><p>In the final version of The Lion King, Scar's death is done at the hands of his own hyenas, who have turned their backs on Scar and attack him.</p><p>The original ending to The Lion King wasn't the only deleted scene that was considered too dark for children. In another deleted scene, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scar decides to improve his reputation</a> by having an heir. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He chooses Nala to be his queen</a> , a much younger lion who Scar would have known since she was a cub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, “Nala, the childhood best pal of Simba comes to Scar’s cave to tell him his kingdom is in complete disarray and something needs to be done to fix all the problems. That is when Scar begins to sing about needing a mate, which includes the line ‘My cylinders are firing with fervor and you, my sweet thing, fit the part.’”</p><p>“As he is singing, Scar continues to back her into a corner until there is nowhere to go, then he puts his front paws up near her head to pin her in. At that point, Nala slaps him. Scar begins to chuckle as he feels his cheek. ‘Oh, Nala, Nala, Nala. You know, you really have no choice. I always get what I want,’” the outlet added. It's easy to see why this scene was left out.</p><h2 id=why-disney-changed-the-lion-king-39-s-original-ending>Why Disney Changed The Lion King's Original Ending</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the-lion-king-ending.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">original ending to The Lion King</a> was changed because<strong> it was deemed too dark for the target family audience</strong>. The original storyboard indicates that Scar says, "Goodnight sweet prince," before throwing Simba to his death. This original ending shows Scar burning alive, laughing through his fiery end. This imagery was just too dark for Disney.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking about the storyboard, for The Lion King one person wrote:</a> "I think that this ending gives a better cap to Scar as a character than the final one. In this one we see Scar is completely consumed by madness and hubris as he believes himself to really be the proper ruler." Another person added: "Wow that's pretty dark. Interesting but dark."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4828833C-9EE1-4585-B91C-1EF45CBEF997.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Real Reason Why Disney Was Sued Over The Lion King ">The Real Reason Why Disney Was Sued Over The Lion King</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Disney got into some hot water with The Lion King back in the day and was sued multiple times.</p><p>Others wonder if the Hamlet reference was a little bit too on the nose for a film about talking lions. The direct line from Hamlet was described by a forum user as "breaking the fourth wall."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another version of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lion King</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> also sees Scar raising Simba</a> after he murders Mufasa. The Disney Theatrical Group president Tom Schumacher explained why Simba also had a very different upbringing than the version we all know and love growing up.</p><p>"The whole idea was that Simba didn't run off with Timon and Pumbaa. Scar was going to kill Simba the same time he kills Mufasa. He's holding Simba in his mouth, and he's about to break his neck. Everyone comes in and says, 'Oh my gosh, you saved him from the stampede!' The idea was [Simba] was going to grow up with Scar, and be the goof-off kid."</p><h2 id=which-scar-death-scene-in-the-lion-king-is-actually-darker>Which Scar Death Scene In The Lion King Is Actually Darker?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scar-lion-king.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the idea of Scar burning to death is terrifying<strong>, it's not as dark as the end cut of </strong><strong>The Lion King</strong>, which sees the lion being killed by his own hyenas.</p><p>An ending where Scar’s hyena allies overhear the villain planning to betray them and kill him was ultimately very effective. There was something poetic about seeing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scar's trickery and lack of loyalty lead to his demise</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-lion-king.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Lion King Featured A Hidden Message That Sparked A Wave Of Controversy">The Lion King Featured A Hidden Message That Sparked A Wave Of Controversy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A message in the clouds had people wondering if Disney was being inappropriate.</p><p>Although <strong>the ending Disney went with is more violent, the original ending is a lot more haunting.</strong> Even small people would be able to understand what happened to Simba's uncle, unlike the ambiguity of the finale edit.</p><p>While Scar visibly falls off the cliff in the final edit of The Lion King, the camera pans away before you can see his definitive fate. We see the shadows of Scar's hyena attack but not the actual death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The original ending shows Scar fading into the fire with no escape.</strong> Him laughing as he dies shows how twisted he is and how he has become so focused on Simba's death, he barely cares about his own life.</p><p>In general, fans of The Lion King prefer the final version more, believing the ending of Scar being betrayed by his allies as being the most fitting. It mirrors the way he betrayed Mufasa and feels like a more justified ending for the villain. Others described this original ending as cliché, saying it was too similar to other Disney villain deaths.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiboquemsZuuMiopWajmaO0brvRop6ippGheqa6w6KloGWjmK6zv4ydnJqsmGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dirt-bike-rider-amelia-kotze-dead-at-age-15-after-race-crash.html><span>←</span><span>Dirt Bike Rider Amelia Kotze Dead at Age 15 After Race Crash</span></a>
