Struggling to make ends meet, Drake was fifteen when he landed a role on <i>Degrassi: The Next Generation</i>, a Canadian teen television series. Inspired by successful rappers, he began his journey as Drake in 2006 and signed onto Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment in 2009. A year later, his debut album earned him mainstream success, and his subsequent albums and releases have been multi-platinum hits. He makes additional revenue from his tours, special performances, and brand endorsements. <a href=#>The rapper has amassed a whopping $250 million fortune</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Drake also ensures that he makes lavish purchases that suit his style, from expensive clothes to supercars worth millions. The rapper also has a vast jewelry collection, from rare diamond necklaces to diamond-encrusted watches. A collection unlike any other, let’s look at the jewelry collection of Drake.</p><h2 id=drake-homer-necklace>Drake Homer Necklace</h2><p>Drake made heads turn in March 2022 when he arrived for a Toronto Raptors v Los Angeles Lakers game wearing a one-of-a-kind necklace. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, the 127.5-carat diamond necklace is created by Frank Ocean’s luxury brand Homer and costs a whopping $1.9 million. It features 9,226 white gold orb diamonds with a sphere legs pendant in the center. One other person only wore the necklace, Frank Ocean himself, at the 2021 Met Gala.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Glance At DJ Khaled's Insane Jewelry Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=stone-island-medallion>Stone Island Medallion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Drake has been a massive fan of Italian luxury brand</a> Stone Island for many years and is often seen donning an outfit from the designer. In 2017, the rapper made Ben Baller design a gold and diamond-encrusted Stone Island logo chain worth $100,000. It featured green, black, and yellow diamonds weighing 880 grams.</p><h2 id=o-necklace>O Necklace</h2><p>Possibly the largest necklace in his collection, the O Necklace made its Instagram debut in 2016 when Drake uploaded a photo with Channing Tatum's caption. Drake purchased the necklace when his fourth studio album, <i>Views</i>, dropped in April. It features a massive ‘O’ pendant encrusted with diamonds from each direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ovo-owl-necklace>OVO Owl Necklace</h2><p>In 2018, Drake texted jewelry designer Jason Arasheben that he had a special project for him. The rapper detailed he wanted a chain with an owl for a pendant. It took six weeks to create the custom chain with 100-carat Asscher-cut diamonds, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High Snobiety</a>. The chain was delivered to Drake in a diamond cage holding the unique owl. Drake is often seen wearing the necklace around his neck.</p><h2 id=cartier-love-bracelet>Cartier Love Bracelet</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a lover of fine jewelry, it is no surprise that Drake owns the celebrity favorite Cartier Love Bracelet. He owns them in white gold, yellow gold, and diamond. The design was first introduced in 1979 and was worn by celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor. Drake was first spotted wearing them in 2018 and has been a regular accessory for many events.</p><h2 id=diamond-rolex-sky-dweller>Diamond Rolex Sky-Dweller</h2><p>While featuring on a track by DJ Khaled, Drake appeared in the music video wearing a Rolex Sky-Dweller. A regular timepiece comes with a sapphire blue case and a strap, but the rapper was seen wearing one with a white gold case. Along with 18-carat white gold, it also has baguette-cut diamond hour markers and a crushed iced dial.</p><h2 id=adonis-necklace>Adonis Necklace</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Drake’s 35th birthday was a big celebration, and the rapper received many gifts from his famous friends. One of the gifts that stood out was a necklace gifted by Young Thug. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HypeBeast</a>, it was customized by Eliantte, and the hefty pendant came with the OVO logo covered in diamonds from all directions. The rear featured a photo of Drake and Adonis from the 2021 Billboard Music Awards and his son’s name carved into stones.</p><h2 id=diamond-6-chain>Diamond 6 Chain</h2><p>Two years before receiving the Adonis Necklace, Drake received another iced-out gift to celebrate his birthday. <a href=#>Lil Wayne gifted him</a> a diamond-encrusted necklace from Eliantte. It had a large pendant with the number ‘6’, which refers to Drake’s song <i>6ix God</i>. Drake often numbers six, as it is the area code for Toronto, and calls himself the self-proclaimed god of the rap scene in Toronto.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=100-carat-heart-necklace>100 Carat Heart Necklace</h2><p>Drake casually dropped $1 million in 2020 to purchase a custom heart necklace from Gemma Fine Jewelry. The piece was commissioned to be made from 22-carat heart-shaped diamonds to create a long chain. The intricate process required a lot of time and took seven months to be made to perfection.</p><h2 id=custom-toronto-raptors-championship-ring>Custom Toronto Raptors Championship Ring</h2><p>As the ambassador and spokesperson for his home NBA team Toronto Raptors, Drake first unveiled the 2018-19 championship rings on his Instagram account. The large rings were adorned with 16 rubies and 650 diamonds to represent the playoff victories until the final, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>. Drake’s custom ring was made by Jason of Beverly Hills and came with 30-carat diamonds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With an appreciation for the finer things in life, Drake does not hesitate to show off his staggering jewels on social media through his Instagram account. He often buys expensive jewels to treat himself and even receives lavish birthday gifts. The rapper continues to add jewels to his collection and make music. His last album, <i>Honestly, Nevermind</i>, was released in June 2022.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Shakira And 9 Other Celebrities That Were Convicted Of Tax Evasion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High Snobiety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HypeBeast</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWKxs63KnqpmopWssq2%2B2GaaqKScmrC1tc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-taika-waititi-s-daughters-actually-get-along-with-his-much-younger-partner-rita-ora.html><span>←</span><span>Do Taika Waititi's Daughters Actually Get Along With His Much Younger Partner, Rita Ora?</span></a>
