According to him, when someone is losing weight, he also loses discipline and goes around like crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was asked whether he would choose <i>physical transformation </i>or prosthetics, he said that a mixture would be great because certain things cannot be achieved with prosthetics.&nbsp;</p><p>Later he talks about how far people have come in the ability to do prosthetics.
