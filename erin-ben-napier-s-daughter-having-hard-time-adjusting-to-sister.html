I think she’s starting to feel a little, like, ‘Well what about me?’”</p><p>The Mississippi native added that Helen is “just now getting into a little bit of … jealousy,” noting that the big sis is still “so sweet” with Mae.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Erin-Ben-Napiers-Daughter-Helen-Having-Hard-Time-Adjusting-Big-Sisterhood-Theres-Jealousy.jpg><p>“Helen is never, ever ugly toward her baby,” Erin explained. “This morning, they were having a ball playing together. It was the first time where Helen was really playing with her. Like, they were friends and not just like, ‘Don’t take my toy.’”</p><p>Ben, 38, chimed in that the siblings bonded over a waffle. “Helen came running up to her, and Mae was so excited and held [the food] out for her and Helen bit it,” the woodworker told Us. “Mae thought that was hilarious. And then they were playing. It was really good.”</p><p>The Home Town stars<a href=#> welcomed their youngest daughter in May 2021</a>, and they don’t see themselves expanding their family any further.</p><p>“I always thought [I’d have] two,” Erin revealed. “When I saw me as a mom, I always saw two kids. I can’t see beyond that, so that feels like a sign that two is the right number.”</p><p>While Ben had a “great” time growing up with three brothers and “loved” his big family, he’s satisfied with Helen having “a lot of cousins on both sides.”</p><p>Prior to Mae’s arrival, the reality stars told Us that they were<a href=#> “talk[ing] about” giving Helen a younger brother or sister</a>.</p><p>“We weren’t trying to get pregnant with Helen and it happened,” Erin explained in January 2021. “If that’s what God wants for us, then it’ll happen again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now that they have two little ones at home, the HGTV personalities have their hands full cleaning up after them, which is why they love their Swiffer WetJet Wood.</p><p>“We love to do a deep clean inside and a pressure wash on the outside, [but] daily maintenance cleaning is so important when you have little ones,” Erin told Us. “Every single day is a new opportunity to bust out the Swiffer and clean the floor. Because they’re very good at spilling things.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaeqpmjeqOxzWalmqiZmr%2B0ecOarKCgpJq%2FbrTAr6Cnn12drrOwjK2gpp1dlrGrwdKtoKefXam8br%2FIrKueql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ben-shelton-ethnicity-exploring-the-rich-ethnicity-and-intriguing-origins.html><span>←</span><span>Ben Shelton Ethnicity: Exploring the Rich Ethnicity and Intriguing Origins!!</span></a>
