The highly anticipated film is even said to be “<a href=#>unlike anything seen before</a>” in the giant cinematic franchise. Because of this, <a href=#>Marvel</a> fans have spent the past few years in a whirlwind of conspiracy and speculation as to what exactly the movie holds in the store for them and <a href=#>who they can expect to see in the film.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch 'Blown Away' By Crew Sacrifices During Filming For 'Doctor Strange 2'</a></span></p><p>With the release of the <a href=#>film’s trailer</a> back in 2021, an entirely new wave of excitement and speculation washed over fans. Conspiracies and <a href=#>rumors reached their peak</a> as many debated online what new and old characters would be appearing in the multiversal feature. So with just a few days to go until the anticipated film hits our screens, let’s take a look at some of the most heavily rumored cameos fans could be seeing in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-as-superior-iron-man><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom Cruise As Superior Iron Man</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe began its vast-expanding journey with Robert Downey Jr.'s iconic Iron Man, another big name had been considered for the pioneering role. Back in 2018, Mission Impossible star and Hollywood A-Lister Tom Cruise revealed that he had initially been offered the role of the genius millionaire but had<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> turned it down </a>as he felt that “it wasn’t going to work out.” However, cut to 2022, and Cruise may finally be suiting up and donning the superhero title… or at least a multiversal version of him. Since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness began filming, it was rumored that Cruise would be portraying the role of Superior Iron Man in the film. A tweet posted by MothCulture even claimed to be confirming this as it revealed what seemed like a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo of Cruise on the set.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lashana-lynch-as-maria-rambeau-captain-marvel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lashana Lynch As Maria Rambeau/Captain Marvel</span></h2><p>One cameo that has seemingly been partly confirmed by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the film’s very own trailer</a> is the appearance of a very special Captain Marvel variant. Upon seeing this, many fans came to the conclusion that the character was not that of Brie Larson’s but instead a variant. Many believe that the trailer actually shows Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) as the superhero. Fans were first introduced to the character of Maria Rambeau way back in 2019 with the release of Captain Marvel. However this time, instead of acting as the heroine’s right-hand woman, Maria herself would be taking on the mantle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Doctor Strange': Marvel Believes Casting Tilda Swinton As 'The Ancient One' Was a Mistake</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teyonah-paris-as-monica-rambeau-captain-marvel><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Teyonah Paris As Monica Rambeau/Captain Marvel</span></h2><p>Alternatively, many also believe that the Captain Marvel variant that is shown in the trailer is not Maria Rambeau but is in fact Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Paris), Maria Rambeau’s daughter. Monica Rambeau was also first introduced as a child in Captain Marvel however returned in 2021 as a fully grown S.W.O.R.D agent in WandaVision. In the series, Paris’ Rambeau gained her own powers by crossing through Wanda Maximoff's (Elizabeth Olsen) hexagonal anomaly. Because of this, many believe that Monica Rambeau will be returning in Multiverse Of Madness and showing off her new skills with the new title of Captain Marvel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophia-di-martino-as-sylvie-laufeydottir-loki><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sophia Di Martino As Sylvie Laufeydottir/Loki</span></h2><p>Another multiversal character first introduced in a Disney+ series who could be appearing in Multiverse Of Madness is Sophia Di Martino’s Sylvie Laufeydottir. First introduced in 2021’s Loki series, the character of Sylvie was one of the MCU’s first examples of a variant as she herself is a variant of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. After dealing with all sorts of multiverse madness in the Loki show, it is possible that Sylvie could be making an appearance in Doctor Strange as a direct follow-up of the events that she and Hiddleston’s Loki caused.</p><h2 id=tom-hiddleston-as-loki-laufeyson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston As Loki Laufeyson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And of course, if the rumors of Sylvie are to be believed, then it’s pretty safe to assume that the MCU’s original god of mischief would be appearing beside her. Back in 2022 Marvel’s main man Kevin Feige even confirmed that the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> events of Loki directly set up what was to come in Doctor Strange</a> In The Multiverse Of Madness. Because of this, many believed that both variants would be appearing in the film in one way or another.</p><h2 id=tobey-maguire-as-spider-man><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tobey Maguire As Spider-Man</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of multiversal events prior to Doctor Strange, many believe that the film will touch on the events that occurred in Spider-Man: No Way Home. After having briefly unleashed the powers of the multiverse in the web slinger’s third film, many believe that the beloved <a href=#>Tobey Maguire will once again be returning to the role</a>. Confirmed cast member Bruce Campbell, who had also appeared in Maguire’s Spider-Man films, even<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> teased a “really cool scene” with a “character that's been beloved for years”</a>. Many believed the actor had been talking about Maguire's Spidey.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Does Benedict Cumberbatch Get Paid For 'Doctor Strange'?</a></span></p><h2 id=john-krasinski-as-mr-fantastic><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>John Krasinski As Mr. Fantastic</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another beloved character from Marvel’s past that is rumored to be making a return in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, is The Fantastic 4’s Mr. Fantastic. Following the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement of a Phase 4 Fantastic 4 project</a> coming to the MCU back in 2021, fans went wild with theories of who will be portraying the characters from the iconic group. After a very special<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Doctor Strange TV spot teaser</a> revealed that the film would be touching on Marvel’s Illuminati, it was all but confirmed that the leader of the supergroup, Reed Richards, would be making an appearance in the film. According to The Daily Mail, a leak seemed to confirm that The Office star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Krasinski would be portraying the character</a> of Mr. Fantastic in the film.</p><h2 id=a-brand-new-wolverine><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Brand New Wolverine?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the appearance of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier in the Doctor Strange trailer sent fans into a meltdown, many were left wondering if the powerful empath would be the only X-Men member to appear in the film. Following Hugh Jackman’s iconic run as Wolverine ending in 2017 with the release of Logan, speculations as to who would take up the mantle of the antihero began to circulate on the internet. Speculations reached their peak in 2022 as many believed that Multiverse Of Madness could potentially give an answer to the heavily debated question and introduce a brand new Wolverine to the screen.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why 'Doctor Strange's' Tilda Swinton Refuses To Have A Movie Trailer While Filming</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irnqzwcyoqZ6cXZiurrHOZpuom6Skv26%2F06uYp5%2BVYrq2uNOirZ6qo5p6sLKMppidppWowG65wKutnqRdl7KvscOimq1lk6q6o7HRm5itm5hk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carole-radziwill-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Carole Radziwill News - Us Weekly</span></a>
