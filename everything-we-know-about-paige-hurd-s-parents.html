She grew up alongside four siblings.</p><p>Per Instagram, Paige’s mother, Cheryl Martin, is the CEO of CMA Entertainment, a talent agency for actors. On 4th February 2020, Paige posted a couple of photos of her mom alongside the following caption: “My World. Happy Birthday Mom @cmaent. I love you.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=contrary-to-popular-misconception-the-late-rapper-dmx-is-not-paiges-father></span>Contrary to popular misconception, the late rapper DMX is not Paige’s father<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In December 2019, Paige took to Instagram to debunk the rumor claiming that the late DMX is her father. DMX is Paige’s godfather, but some people misread it and conclude that the pair share a biological connection.</p><p>In an Instagram post explaining the pair’s matching tattoos, Paige stated that DMX and his ex-wife Tashera Simmons adopted her into their family as their goddaughter. Paige and DMX starred in her first feature film&nbsp;Cradle 2 The Grave.&nbsp;She captioned the post as follows:</p><p>“My favorite song my pops ever did is called RIGHT, WRONG. In the film at the end (when I finally was rescued from being kidnapped) when we are reunited this song plays as we walk away. Pops had his tatt (he wrote it) and I told him I wanted to get it in his exact handwriting so he wrote it out and boom, matching taaaatttsss surprised him father’s day 2016.”</p><p>Paige and DMX shared many special moments. Perhaps the most memorable one was when DMX lost his cool after Hurd used the face swap feature on Snapchat while recording a video with her godfather.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlp5p6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW68wKKenmWYqr%2Blv4ypmKudnqnAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-has-the-best-jewelry-collection-in-the-world-take-a-look.html><span>←</span><span>Drake Has The Best Jewelry Collection In The World, Take A Look!</span></a>
