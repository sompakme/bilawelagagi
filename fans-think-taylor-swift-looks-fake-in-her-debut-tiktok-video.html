However, many fans feel as though she looked like an impersonator in her video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift has kept herself busy re-recording the six albums she previously released with Big Machine Records, after a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">legal battle dispute</a> with music proprietor Scooter Braum. Earlier this year, she released <a href=#>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</a> — a re-recording of her 2008 album. Coming up next is a new rendition of her 2012 pop album Red which housed the singles, "We Are Never Getting Back Together" and "Begin Again."</p><p>The 31-year-old singer surprised fans, joining the popular social media network TikTok. On August 23, Swfift posted a video rocking some of her infamous past looks. Calling back to her previous eras, the star wrote, "Lots going on at the moment: Red (my version) vinyl is up for presale on my site and oh I’m on tiktok now let the games begin."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this short video, Swift dons outfits seen in her Folklore, Evermore, and Fearless promotional images. She ends the video with straightened long hair, blunt bangs, and a black turtleneck, shouting out the fashion style she favored when first recording Red.</p><p>In response, many fans light-heartedly teased the singer for her basic outfits and heavily filtered look, saying that she looks more like a "doppelganger" than the actual Taylor Swift. One fan wrote, " "Y'all it's real, I really thought it was deep fake or her look alike. Taylor Swift really joined TikTok."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another said, "Taylor hired a doppelganger to make TikToks for her."</p><p>A third fan chimed in, tweeting, "This is so weird. Why does this not look like her?? It looks like these people who think they look like Taylor so they dress up like her all the time goodbye."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Taylor Swift Doesn’t Speak To Lorde Anymore</a></span></p><p>While Swift's self-cosplaying may need some more work, she never fails to draw the attention of her fans. When first announcing her Red (Taylor's Version) album, the singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a short video</a>, releasing multiple word-jumbles out a locked vault. Fans were quickly able to decipher the puzzle, finding that the upcoming album will include multiple collaborations with big-name singers, like <a href=#>Phoebe Bridgers</a> and Ed Sheeran.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Opening up about her latest re-recording, Swift shared to Instagram, "Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Songs Taylor Swift Has Written About Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><p>She added, "this will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red.
