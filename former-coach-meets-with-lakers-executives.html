In his meeting with Lakers executive vice president Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak on Saturday, Jackson asked for travel restrictions, a big salary and more say over basketball decisions. The travel restrictions would minimize the amount of time he spent on the road with the Lakers, who usually play 39 games away from the Staples Center.</p><p>Jackson, 67, is believed to be the most sought after candidate. He has the most championship titles as a coach and player — apart from the Lakers, Jackson led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships in the early ’90s — to his name than anyone else in NBA history. The meeting ended with both parties deciding that they would reconvene in a couple days.</p><p>“He’s intrigued by the job but not completely sure it’s the right thing to do,” a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow>ESPN</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, the Lakers are continuing their search. Coaches Mike D’Antoni, Nate McMillan and Mike Dunleavy are all being considered for the job and have reportedly been contacted via phone. While the Lakers try to figure out who their next coach will be, Bernie Bickerstaff is coaching in the interim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W1qriMo5ico6Oku27Bz52YrZ1dm7yzucSrZJynkZi1brnEnqusZZyWuKa%2B0macsZ2TqsGqwsSsZGppaW2FeXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emile-steyaert-player-profile-23-24.html><span>←</span><span>Emile Steyaert - Player profile 23/24</span></a>
