The brand, which includes a tabloid website and TV shows&nbsp;<a href=#>operated by Harvey Levin</a>, will join <a href=#>the Murdoch Empire</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Attorney and former legal TV correspondent Harvey Levin founded the brand in 2005 with the late Warner Bros.

The $50 million valuation is only a fraction of the $100 million to $125 million the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal reported last month</a> the company was being valued at in negotiations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sale comes after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources claim Levin had told Warner Media executives that he was unlikely to remain at the company</a> if it continued under the Warner Media umbrella, and Fox quickly emerged as the only realistic buyer, which may explain the somewhat surprising valuation.</p><p>TMZ has been known for its <a href=#>brazen tabloid approach</a> and landing some of the entertainment industry’s biggest scoops, including the deaths of Michael Jackson and <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a>. The brazen approach of the website has resulted in numerous controversies and criticisms, including the publishing of redacted details obtained from the Los Angeles County Coroner regarding the demise of Linkin Park's frontman&nbsp; Chester Bennington. In 2013 a TMZ reporter filmed an attack involving Andre Lowe that resulted in his death, the video was posted to the website without the permission of the family and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received widespread condemnation.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rich & Morty Creator Bringing First Blockchain Animated Series For Fox</a></span></p><p>Under the deal, Fox will run TMZ’s flagship website and culture website TooFab.com, as well as its syndicated television programs and even the TMZ celebrity bus tours.</p><p>Fox already has ties to TMZ as the network is the primary broadcast partner for TMZ shows TMZ on TV and TMZ Live. TMZ has also produced specials for Fox’s entertainment unit, including Harry & Meghan: The Royals in Crisis&nbsp;and UFOs: The Pentagon Proof, and a sports gossip show that is carried by the Fox Sports 1 cable network.</p><p>In a statement, Levin said having his operation under Fox Entertainment, “is opening up a world of opportunities for TMZ to grow our current platforms and expand in every which way!”</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Rock And Redbird Capital Have Bought The XFL For $15 Million</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzsMSMm6yyq12Ysq2xwaugrbFdnLy0v8ipZJuqkaOxbsDMs2Sfp6Jiuaa%2F0maroZmeYoJxecyio6Whn6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./26-best-spider-man-memes-and-gifs.html><span>←</span><span>26 Best Spider-Man Memes and Gifs</span></a>
