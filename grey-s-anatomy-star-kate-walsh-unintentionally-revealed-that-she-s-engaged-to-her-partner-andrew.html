She is best known for her role as Dr. Addison Montgomery on the ABC television dramas Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice Kate Walsh accidentally revealed her own relationship milestone during an Instagram Live on Wednesday.</p><p>The<i> Grey's Anatomy</i> star accidentally let it slip that she and boyfriend Andrew Nixon were engaged during an Instagram Live she did with actress Amy Brenneman to commemorate the 15th anniversary of their former show,<i> Private Practice</i>.</p><p>"Here comes the jungle cat, that is my fiancé," Kate, 54, said during the Oct. 5 video as she panned the camera to Andrew, who smiled and waved.</p><p>Catching the leak, Amy noted, "She just 100 percent outed your engagement."</p><p>Kate replied, "I did, I just outed our engagement," as Andrew said, "Aww."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the Live, the<i> 13 Reasons Why</i> actress flashed her massive diamond ring on camera and shared a kiss with her fiancé. Kate later posted a photo to her Instagram Stories of two martini glasses along with the caption, "Celebrating with w/@andynix1!!"</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Grey’s Anatomy Meredith Grey Diagnosed With COVID-19</b></a></span></p><p>Walsh, whose ring could be seen during the video, then confirmed, “I did.

The pair now share a home in Perth, where they spent lockdown together during the height of the pandemic, according to<a href=#><i> Digital Spy.</i></a></p><p>Nixon is part of a family farming enterprise called Nixon Farming in the Moora/New Norcia region of Western Australia, where they run Merino sheep as well as rotate wheat, barley and canola.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Walsh is set to <a href=#>reprise her role</a> as Dr. Addison Montgomery in season 19 of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, which premieres on ABC in the US today (October 6).
