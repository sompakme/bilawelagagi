What was he looking at?” Seacrest asked the No Doubt frontwoman.</p><p><span>“Try to picture being a mom and going to a football game on the weekend with your kids and being surrounded by 30 cameras,” she told the radio host. “I was literally going across the field, like, trying to stroll [and] get into the car, and [was] being completely swarmed. [I was] doing it as fast as I could and I literally opened the back of the truck and all the groceries fell out … and, like, I am trying to rush because everybody’s watching me … and all the other parents are getting mad. … So I’m, like, trying to open my door and, like, not one, but two basketballs and a football fell out,” Stefani explained. “So he was looking at the balls.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Embarrassing moment aside, things are going smoothly between the couple, who first stepped out together over Halloween weekend, following their respective divorces. Stefani’s rep confirmed exclusively to<i> Us </i>in November that the two were dating.</p><p>Stefani released a new track on Friday titled “Make Me Like You,” and the lyrics are clearly about the hunky country crooner.</p><p><span>“I was fine before I met you / I was broken but fine / I was lost and uncertain / But my heart was still mine / I was free before I met you / I was broken but free / All alone in the clear view / But now you are all I see,” the lyrics go. “I really like you, but I’m so scared / Why’d you have to go and make me like you? … I’m so mad at you, ’cause now you got me missing you.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As previously reported, the two bonded over their failed marriages. Shelton and ex-wife <b>Miranda Lambert</b> announced they were divorcing this past July after four years of marriage. One month later, Stefani and <b>Gavin Rossdale</b>, who were married for 13 years, announced their own split.</p><p>“Gwen’s moved on with somebody better, who is really good to her,” a source previously told <i>Us</i> of her new man, while another added: “He’s a very nurturing, supportive guy, so she found a good one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagr5WjerTAxJ%2BYp6FdmsWxuMCipaxllqq7r8WMqZ%2BorJ9ivKd5waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWanl6G2r7OMoZyrZadmg3V%2BlWtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dennis-swanberg-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Dennis Swanberg Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
