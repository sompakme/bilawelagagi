The best part about this fabulous fad is it works for all of Us. It doesn’t matter what body type or shape you have — a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">square neckline</a> is always going to flatter your figure!</p><p>To embrace the aesthetic, we need to find the right bras which will look great underneath this particular shape, and the balconette style is absolutely ideal for the job. This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bra from </a><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">HACI</a> is particularly excellent, and we have an inkling that it’s well on its way to becoming an Amazon bestseller.

It’s lightly padded and has a slight push up effect due to the balconette shape. Because the cups are cut particularly low and the straps are further off to the side, it’s not going to peek out. In fact, the goal is to remain virtually invisible. You can wear a strapless option to avoid this pesky problem too, but you’re not getting the same support this bra can provide because of the added straps.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">HACI Women’s Balconette Demi Bra</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25</a> at Amazon!

We enjoy wearing fun lingerie because it makes Us feel good — it’s not necessarily for someone else to see. This bra has the power to be a major confidence-booster, but it’s particularly practical at the same time. It’s a solid everyday piece which deserves a spot in the rotation. And at this price point, the deal is remarkable. Shoppers say they’re eagerly waiting for more colors to drop to freshen up their selection. Clearly, this is the type of staple bra you want to have to match with everything you own.
