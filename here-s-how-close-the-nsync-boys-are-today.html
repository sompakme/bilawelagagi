In fact, they may be closer now than they were 15 years ago. Since going on an indefinite hiatus in 2002, the members of *NSYNC (Chris Kirkpatrick, Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone and Lance Bass) have all had a successful life, whether that was through their career or personal life.</p><p>No matter if it's weddings, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">birthdays</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walk Of Fame stars</a>, or other events, these five men also have been and always will be there for each other, even if they aren't reuniting for a tour anytime soon (to fans' dismay).</p><p>Here's how close the *NSYNC boys are today.</p><h2 id=their-group-chat><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Their Group Chat</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, Chris Kirkpatrick revealed that the *NSYNC guys <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have a group chat</a> to keep in touch. Joey Fatone revealed to Page Six what actually goes down in the chat. He texted them 'happy fourth,' but they guys did not respond. He said that sometimes they answer and sometimes they don't and the chat is like a bulletin board.</p><p>Kirkpatrick also revealed the sex of his unborn baby at the time through the chat. They joke and jab at each other and update each other about their lives, whether or not they see it. So yes, the guys still keep in touch to this day and that makes us emotional.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Lance Bass Has Been Up To Since *NSYNC</a></span></p><h2 id=celebrating-celebrity-s-20th-anniversary><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Celebrating 'Celebrity's' 20th Anniversary</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Celebrity,' *NSYNC's third and final album turned 20 on July 24. I know, we're old. Lance and JC posted about the anniversary and *NSYNC <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released merchandise</a> to celebrate the anniversary, which featured the Celebrity and PopOdyseey Tour. Last year, the boys celebrated the 20th anniversary of their best-selling album, No Strings Attached. They all appeared on Bass' podcast and reflected back on the memories of that time. It was great to hear opinions and memories from each of them and see how they are still close all these years later.</p><h2 id=zoom-calls-during-quarantine><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Zoom Calls During Quarantine</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the zoom calls were mostly for their interviews on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lance Bass' podcast</a>, he revealed that the calls bonded them even more, especially during quarantine, on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. But, they enjoyed the interviews so much that they have grown so much closer and partake in weekly zoom calls with each other.</p><p>“Your relationships, they get tighter, so now we have happy hours every week together on Zoom, which is fun,” he added. All five of the boys took part, and we would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in that conversation.</p><h2 id=lance-and-joey-are-still-best-friends><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lance And Joey Are Still Best Friends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all of the boys calling themselves brothers, Lance Bass and Joey Fatone have always had a really special bond. Bass is the godfather of one of Fatone's daughters, and Fatone was one of the first people Bass told he was gay. They stared in On The Line together and proved how close they were. To this day, the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remain best friends</a>. They partnered up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstreet Boys</a>' AJ McLean and Nick Carter for a pride event in June. They performed some of their biggest hits as BackSync and had a really great time. The boys debated on whether or not to form the super group and go on tour.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Most Fans Don't Know About *NSYNC</a></span></p><h2 id=justin-jokes-around-with-lance-in-a-tiktok><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Justin Jokes Around With Lance In A TikTok</span></h2><p>Bass continued to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 'Celebrity' by Facetiming all of the boys. However, he played a prank on them by saying he had to go and to call them back later, even though he was the one who was calling them. Timberlake did not pick up, so he did not get the joke, but he<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> revealed later</a> that once Bass has his two kids, he will know why he didn't pick up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that did make fans happy, though, was that as Bass was out to dinner during one call, the camera panned and showed he was out with JC Chasez. So, there are no hard feelings there. Everyone is just busy sometimes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Members Of N-Sync, Then & Now (In Pictures)&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=will-there-be-a-reunion-tour><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will There Be A Reunion Tour?</span></h2><p>Because the boys are still so close to this day with no bad blood, fans have been begging for years for a reunion tour. However, the timing has never been right, and with four out of five members being dads and all of them in their 40s, they don't know how they could make it possible, but they aren't <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ruling anything out</a>. When asked on the podcast if they would do anything, everyone answered yes except for Chasez. He believes they were big then and they shouldn't ruin that. But what he doesn't understand is that a reunion tour would sell out in seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been rumors and talks of a BackSync tour or even a Backstreet Boys/*NSYNC/NKOTB tour, which would literally shatter the world. They have reunited in the past for their Walk Of Fame Star, birthdays, weddings, Timberlake's Video Vanguard performance and Coachella, so they obviously can still rock it. Whether they reunite or not, we love to know that they are still close today.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which NSYNC Song Are You, Based On Your Zodiac?&nbsp;</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmmqWno5p6tbTEZqWssZ6YeqO72KxkmqqVYsGwsMCyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwen-stefani-explains-funny-photo-of-blake-shelton-ogling-her.html><span>←</span><span>Gwen Stefani Explains Funny Photo of Blake Shelton Ogling Her</span></a>
