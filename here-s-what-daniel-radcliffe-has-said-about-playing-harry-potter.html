Here’s what he has said about working on one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most successful film franchises</a> in Hollywood:</p><h2 id=he-was-in-the-bath-when-he-learned-that-he-got-cast-as-harry-potter><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Was In The Bath When He Learned That He Got Cast As Harry Potter</span></h2><p>“I was in the bath. I guess talking to my mum about something, I don't know what, and then my dad came in,” Radcliffe told Thrillist. “I remember hearing the phone ring, and I remember it being picked up, and then three minutes later my dad just came up the stairs and he was like, 'They're going to tell you officially tomorrow, but we've just got the call sounding us out, it's happening,' and I freaked out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-believes-it-was-his-enthusiasm-that-won-him-the-role><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Daniel Radcliffe Believes It Was His Enthusiasm That Won Him The Role</span></h2><p>Radcliffe told The Huffington Post, “The thing that I will always say about myself is I was not the most gifted child actor.” The actor added, “When I look at other young actors, like when I look at the kids on ‘Stranger Things’ or shows like that, I’m just like, ‘Holy! My god! How are you doing that?’ It’s amazing. The thing I think I really was good at, and the thing I had, which was a huge advantage for me, was I just loved it.”</p><h2 id=the-first-day-of-shooting-the-sorcerer-s-stone-was-the-most-nerve-wracking-thing-for-him><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The First Day Of Shooting ‘The Sorcerer’s Stone’ Was ‘The Most Nerve-Wracking Thing’ For Him</span></h2><p>“The most nerve-wracking thing was the first day, because before that it had just been me, Rupert [Grint], Emma [Watson], and Chris, rehearsing in Chris's office,” Radcliffe told BBC.</p><p>He continued: “I got the call sheet for the first day, I looked under the cast and it said "Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint". So I thought, Fine, I'm used to that. Then I turned over the page and it said: "Extras, 150." At that moment, I got quite scared.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=working-on-the-franchise-at-11-years-old-and-being-able-to-do-some-stunts-was-heaven-to-him><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Working On The Franchise At 11 Years Old And Being Able To Do Some Stunts Was ‘Heaven’ To Him</span></h2><p>“Imagine being an 11-year-old boy and being told, ‘You’re going to run around on crash mats and jump on trampolines.’ It was kind of heaven,” Radcliffe told Deadline. “I do feel any actor who has an interest in doing stunts and wants to be involved in that stuff as much as they can, you need to build up a relationship with your stunt double, or at least the stunt department. If you don’t, they’ll never know what you’re capable of.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe And Karan Soni Divulge Peculiar Secret About Early Harry Potter Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=he-believes-that-he-could-have-used-an-acting-coach-while-working-on-the-films><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Believes That He Could Have Used An Acting Coach While Working On The Films</span></h2><p>“If we had a singing scene, we had a singing teacher come in. If we had a dance scene, a dance coach would come in,” Radcliffe told Melvyn Bragg while appearing on “The South Bank Show.” “We never had an acting coach in all the time we were there, and there were times we could have done with one.

It was very different. But it was also like, I think it’s the best decision that was ever made for the series,” Radcliffe told The Huffington Post. “Because it just changed how people saw us and it changed the perception of what we were trying to do. “Oh, they’re trying to make something different!” He had just come off “Y Tu Mamá También,” so that was people’s frame of reference for Alfonso.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=for-a-35-foot-drop-stunt-in-the-goblet-of-fire-radcliffe-said-the-stunt-team-talked-him-through-it><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>For A 35-Foot Drop Stunt In ‘The Goblet Of Fire,’ Radcliffe Said The Stunt Team Talked Him Through It</span></h2><p>“They talked me through it and said, ‘It’s 35 feet. Do you think you can do that?’ Radcliffe told Deadline. “At 14 or 15, you’re full of bravado in front of a bunch of stuntmen, so I was like, ‘Yeah, of course I can.’” He added, “In retrospect, I look back on it and think it was pretty crazy that I was allowed to do that. 35 feet is a lot higher than you think once you get up there.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Thirsting For Daniel Radcliffe</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-pretty-sure-it-was-the-prop-guys-who-wrote-his-name-for-the-goblet-of-fire-scene-because-he-has-bad-handwriting><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He’s Pretty Sure It Was The Prop Guys Who Wrote His Name For The Goblet Of Fire Scene Because He Has Bad Handwriting</span></h2><p>During a Reddit AMA, Radcliffe revealed, “You know what, I don't think we did I'm pretty sure.

She's a very pleasant person, and when I'm with her, I'm happy. And she's also a very intellectual person. It is really wonderful that I'm working with her, and I love the scenes with her most.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-were-two-times-when-he-slightly-feared-filming-the-goblet-of-fire><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>There Were Two Times When He ‘Slightly Feared’ Filming ‘The Goblet Of Fire’</span></h2><p>“There was a case I slightly feared about two times in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" but there wasn't in this movie,” Radcliffe said while speaking with Cinema Today Japan. “But I'm always watched by very excellent staff regarding stunts who are very steady, so I think I didn't have a dangerous experience this time.”</p><h2 id=in-the-order-of-the-phoenix-he-admits-to-being-nervous-while-filming-the-kissing-scene-with-katie-leung><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>In ‘The Order Of The Phoenix,’ He Admits To Being ‘Nervous’ While Filming The Kissing Scene With Katie Leung</span></h2><p>“I think we were both a bit nervous because we did know everyone was talking about it and there was the knowledge that this was a highly anticipated scene and that everybody had been waiting for this scene in some ways,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe told Indie London</a>. “We were a bit nervous but after the first few takes it was fine and we started thoroughly enjoying ourselves!”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe Reconnects With Fans By Reading Harry Potter And The Sorcerer’s Stone</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-thought-he-was-trying-almost-too-much-while-filming-the-forest-scene-with-ralph-fiennes-in-the-deathly-hallows><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Thought He Was ‘Trying Almost Too Much’ While Filming The Forest Scene With Ralph Fiennes In ‘The Deathly Hallows’</span></h2><p>“I think pressure is a good thing and it’s good to be able to feel it and use it and experience the feeling of it and especially if you can get past it, but for some reason on that scene on that day I was really…I so wanted it to be good,” Radcliffe told Collider. “I was probably trying almost too much too many different things. But yeah, it was good.”</p><h2 id=he-noted-that-emma-watson-wasn-t-around-as-much-while-filming-the-deathly-hallows-because-she-was-studying><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Noted That Emma Watson Wasn’t Around As Much While Filming ‘The Deathly Hallows’ Because She Was Studying</span></h2><p>“It’s been very odd on this film in a way because Emma’s not been here for the past bit because she’s been studying,” Radcliffe told Collider while discussing his relationship with longtime co-stars, Watson and Rupert Grint. “So it’s been slightly disrupted on this film so it’s been peculiar. But yeah, we have gotten on very, very well. We’ve got other friends as well, I think it’s important to say.

I was good at being on set,” Radcliffe told The Huffington Post. “I loved learning how to be helpful. The greatest thing about being on set is you get to be part of a team. That’s the most special thing about it, and you get to feel like with everyone else you are making this thing together, and I loved that feeling straight away. I think that was definitely what made me a great fit for those films.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Emma Watson And Daniel Radcliffe In Real Life?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGiusieo2aqkZmwrbXFn5xmoJGoerStyJ1kmpqfqsFuvMuasKKml2K1or7RsmSpp6SpsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./26-english-words-phrases-we-d-like-to-get-rid-of.html><span>←</span><span>26 English Words &amp;amp; Phrases We'd Like To Get Rid Of</span></a>
