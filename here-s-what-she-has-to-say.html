Same.</p><p>This family has been in our hearts for 11 seasons and we don't feel like it's actually over, either.

But I’m really happy with the way that she has grown, and there have been some situations where she has been forced to grow even more so."&nbsp; We totally agree because it's not possible to grow up without messing up sometimes and learning those important lessons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-didn-t-like-that-haley-was-absent-from-her-own-grandpa-s-funeral><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sarah&nbsp;Didn't Like That Haley&nbsp;Was Absent From Her Own Grandpa's Funeral</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ty-Burrell-Fred-Willard.jpg><p>We all found it weird when Haley didn't attend her own grandpa's funeral, right? It was such an obvious absence that seems hard to explain away.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Buzzfeed, Sarah Hyland didn't like this, either, and it's something that she has spoken out against.
