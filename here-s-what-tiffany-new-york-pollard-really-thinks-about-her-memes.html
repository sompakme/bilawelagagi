Being open with her emotions gets her attention, but comes with challenges of its own.</p><p>"It's not always easy to be this real. You guys have seen some of the most vulnerable times in my life," she says. "You guys have seen me at my best and my worst. So I need to just be able to be real...I always think it's important to stay true to that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Was Paris Hilton Faking Her Level Of Intelligence For Reality TV?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=some-of-the-memes-bring-back-bad-memories>Some of the Memes Bring Back Bad Memories</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imagge.jpg><p>Tiffany's most viral memes involve her fighting with a girl named Pumkin (who spits on her in front of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flavor Flav</a>) and sitting alone on a bed.</p><p>"Being spit on, on national television. That was a lot of rage and a lot of just emotions," she recalls. As for the bed meme:</p><p>"I literally remember how I was feeling in that moment. And I was frustrated," she explains. "I was pissed off. I was angry. I'm just sitting there. And now for that moment to play out like that is a huge meme. I'm like, only if they knew what I was going through. I was not happy with these girls."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiffany 'NY' Pollard Calls This Trait In Men A Major Red Flag</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wants-to-be-an-inspiration>She Wants To Be an Inspiration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imageee.jpg><p>Nobody can deny that Tiffany Pollard's confidence is inspirational. She calls herself the official HBIC! But this reality TV legend believes her memes have an inspirational message of their own: it's okay for women to get loud.</p><p>"Your voice is important. It needs to be heard and your emotions are important and those things need to be expressed," she explains. "Hey, we don't have to be demure and silent and quiet.
