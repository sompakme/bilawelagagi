The sequel and standalone to follow, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, recently premiered on Netflix in December, ending up dazzling audiences with even more twists, another stellar performance by Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc, and an even more star-studded cast with the likes of Janelle Monáe, Edward Norton, Kathryn Hahn, Dave Bautista, and Kate Hudson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With plans for more Knives Out mysteries in the works people are eagerly fan casting who they'd love to see pop up next. Here are eight actors that fans have been vocal about wanting to see them stand up against Benoit Blanc.</p><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Coolidge</span></h2><p>People are finally appreciating and taking Jennifer Coolidge seriously, but she's still known for her comedic spontaneity and antics fans adore. Finding herself back in the spotlight lately for her performance on the HBO show The White Lotus, people have been very vocal about wanting her to appear in numerous projects, including a Knives Out film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She would bring the perfect amount of camp to the movie as well as, if given the chance, a great unassuming villain. Frankly, we just want to see her opposite Daniel Craig and make him squirm a little.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Next For Jennifer Coolidge After Her White Lotus Season 2 Exit?</a></span></p><h2 id=jenna-ortega><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jenna Ortega</span></h2><p>2022 was quite a year for actress <a href=#>Jenna Ortega</a>, after starring in fan favorite projects like the show Wednesday, Scream (2022), and the horror film X. She's already proven her detective skills on Wednesday, so perhaps she could take on the role of the main female lead that always seems to team up with Benoit Blanc, but this time we'd see a younger actress at the forefront.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After receiving a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance as Wednesday Addams, she's sure to have a bright future head regardless - solving one mystery or another.</p><h2 id=pedro-pascal><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Pedro Pascal</span></h2><p>Pedro Pascal has become one of Hollywood's newest leading men, headlining in The Mandalorian and now bringing life to the character of Joel for the video game adaptation of <a href=#>The Last of Us</a> on HBO. Fans have jokingly picked up on the fact that he keeps playing roles that are "daddies", and we think him playing a father role in a Knives Out film would fit nicely with the roster.</p><p>Maybe he can even be a parent to Jenna Ortega? If not that, he's taken on a slew of comedic roles that let him and the audience have a laugh, proving that he's down for any type of character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keke-palmer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Keke Palmer</span></h2><p>Palmer has had a varied career, from starring on the Nickelodeon channel to performing on a Broadway stage as Cinderella, but it wasn't until Jordan Peele's 2022 release, Nope, that people began to truly acknowledge how much talent she has and how she lights up a screen. She's another contender for a wise, young woman to team up with Blanc, similar to Janelle Monáe.</p><p>She's known for bringing a light-hearted tone to even the most serious of situations, evident in a horror film like Nope, so she'd bring that much-needed levity and sarcastic voice audiences come to appreciate in the Knives Out films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Has Hollywood Been Sleeping On Keke Palmer All These Years?</a></span></p><h2 id=hugh-grant><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hugh Grant</span></h2><p>After seeing a quick <a href=#>cameo</a> of Grant in Glass Onion, presumably as a man romantically involved with detective Blanc, we feel that there's more to see of his character - not even necessarily to do with a mystery. It would be wonderful to see more gay representation in a major studio franchise as well as explore a dynamic between Grant and Craig as a crime solving duo.</p><p>Grant could join Blanc on a case or the film could explore how they met and a case that brought them together, either way we think his character deserves much more than a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> cameo spot</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aubrey-plaza><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aubrey Plaza</span></h2><p>Another White Lotus favorite, Plaza has become another of Hollywood's comedic darlings, with her specialty coming through that of deadpan. Many of the characters in the Knives Out films are outrageously colorful and expressive, but having a character that is monotone and serious could add another layer, similar to Jamie Lee Curtis's performance in the first film.</p><p>If she were the one to team up with Blanc, we can already see him regretting his decision when she starts to point out obvious things or solve the case before him. In any capacity, we think the other characters would underestimate her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About Aubrey Plaza</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-driver><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Adam Driver</span></h2><p>People can't get enough of Adam Driver, they love him, and so does Knives Out director Rian Johnson who directed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a>, with Driver portraying the villainous Kylo Ren. Ever since the first Knives Out arrived in 2019, many viewers have been clamoring for Driver to join a potential sequel due to their Star Wars connection.</p><p>Similarly to Plaza, Driver has a dry humor but also a willingness to play any role, regardless of the circumstances, much like Pascal. Maybe he'll also have a famous sweater moment like Chris Evans that will go viral.</p><h2 id=bryan-cranston><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bryan Cranston</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the greatest actors in recent history, Cranston has brought us some of the best dramatic characters on television like the evil<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Walter White</a> in Breaking Bad as well as lighthearted ones like the goofball father Hal in Malcolm in the Middle. He's shown he can do both comedy and drama in his many roles through cinema and television, making him a stellar choice for the next Knives Out outing.</p><p>They could go many different ways with his character - the eccentric old man, the criminal mastermind, or the wisecracking foil to Blanc. Maybe he can even pop in as another detective with ties to Blanc's past, creating a competition between the two?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddm66vv4ywpq6klGK5qrfEZquoZaOasm61zWaroZ1do7K5wIykpaKulah6sMHTZqSyq6Sav7p7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gangsta-boo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Gangsta Boo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
