Michael provided the speaking voice for Leon, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;character's singing voice was performed by a soundalike due to contractual obligations Jackson had with his record company. Jackson's guest appearance was also uncredited for similar contractual reasons and wasn't officially confirmed until Groenig's 2018 interview.</p><p>In 1998, <i><a title="TV Guide" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Guide</a></i> listed&nbsp;"Stark Raving Dad" in its list of top twelve <i>Simpsons</i> episodes, and in 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CinemaBlend</a>'s Eric Eisenberg gave it even higher praise, saying that it&nbsp;"is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leaving-neverland-led-to-his-episode-being-pulled-from-syndication>Leaving Neverland Led To His Episode Being Pulled From Syndication</h2><p>Shortly after the premiere of the documentary Leaving Neverland,&nbsp;which details allegations against Jackson of exploiting children,&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;pulled "Stark Raving Dad" from circulation. Fans quickly&nbsp;noticed its absence from Disney+ upon&nbsp;the streaming service's release last November and&nbsp;speculated about what might have happened.</p><p>Showrunner Al Jean&nbsp;justified the episode's removal by claiming&nbsp;that Jackson used his cameo on the show for a “false purpose," and told&nbsp;The Daily Beast&nbsp;that the decision to pull the episode, which he co-wrote, was difficult. However, while he stated that "it wasn’t something that makes me happy," he agreed with the decision “completely."</p><h2 id=this-simpsons-showrunners-worry-jackson-used-his-episode-to-groom-boys>This Simpsons Showrunners&nbsp;Worry Jackson Used His Episode To "Groom" Boys</h2><p>When Jean was asked to elaborate on what he meant by his claim that Jackson had a "false purpose" for lending his voice to "Stark Raving Dad," he said that after watching Leaving Neverland,&nbsp;he and his fellow showrunners believe the singer used his appearance on the popular animated series to "groom boys."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It wasn’t just a comedy to him, it was something that was used as a tool. And I strongly believe that. That, to me, is my belief, and it’s why I think removing it is appropriate," he stated. “I think it was part of what he used to groom boys. I really don’t know, and I should be very careful because this is not something I know personally, but as far as what I think, that’s what I think. And that makes me very, very sad.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Weird Rules Michael Jackson’s Staff Had To Follow On The Road</a></span></p><h2 id=taking-down-stark-raving-dad-felt-like-their-only-option>Taking Down "Stark Raving Dad" Felt Like Their Only Option</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wall Street Journal</a> last year,&nbsp;Simpsons&nbsp;executive producer James L.
