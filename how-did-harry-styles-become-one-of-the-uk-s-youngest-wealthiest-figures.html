No, he is not a criminal, but he is in the business of stealing hearts and making money.</p><p>The year of 2023 has been a big one for Harry Styles; the multi-faceted star has won 37 awards, including prestigious Grammy and American Music Awards (two times each). Harry's House, his third album, is shattering records.</p><p>Love On Tour has also been a massive success (included among the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest grossing concerts of all time</a>), and he is now among the United Kingdom's youngest, wealthiest figures.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-rsquo-life-before-fame><strong>Harry Styles’ Life Before Fame</strong></h2><p>This Grammy winner's success did not happen overnight; during his childhood, his family relocated from Redditch, Worcestershire, to Village Holmes Chapel in Cheshire. Harry’s parents divorced when he was just 7 years old; however Harry is grateful for his parents' support, and he fondly remembers his "great childhood."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At a very young age, Styles began singing cover songs on a karaoke machine. A young Harry, who had no connections to the music industry, began to dream of conquering it.</p><p>Styles attended Chapel Comprehensive School, where he became the lead singer for the band White Eskimo. Later, White Eskimo emerged as the winner of the local Battle Of The Bands Competition. However, Harry remained relatively unknown to the world.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Harry-Styles-And-Taylor-Swift.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>All Of Harry Styles Girlfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Popstar Harry Styles has dated several famous women over the years.</span><h2 id=a-life-changing-idea><strong>A Life Changing Idea</strong></h2><p>Harry Styles' mother provided him with an idea to participate in the show X Factor, and in 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles auditioned for the competition-based show</a>. Harry took the stage, and after an introduction and some humorous banter with Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, and Cheryl Cole, a confident sixteen-year-old Styles sang "Hey Soul Sister" by Train.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The future One Direction sensation looked confident ... but Simon Cowell believed that the track was not right for him ... leading Styles to then cover Stevie Wonder’s “Isn’t She Lovely.”</p><p>Harry was initially selected for X Factor's "boot camp," but to his dismay, he didn't make it to the next round. That rejection was the most decisive moment of his life, but he didn't realize it back then.</p><h2 id=the-creation-of-one-direction><strong>The Creation Of One Direction</strong></h2><p>It wasn't just Harry Styles who faced rejection on X Factor ... Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson also received disapproving nods from mentor Simon Cowell. They practiced together for two weeks on X Factor and forged a strong bond, ultimately deciding to form a band.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The name "One Direction" was Harry Styles' suggestion, and as you may have guessed, all other members of the new band concurred. Cowell summoned them once again on X Factor, where the group showed their talent to the world, and ranked in third place.</p><h2 id=the-success-of-one-direction-and-harry-styles-39-wealth><strong>The Success Of One Direction, And Harry Styles' Wealth</strong></h2><p>Simon Cowell (who initially rejected all five boys in the band) came to acknowledge the musical potential present among the members of the newly formed One Direction. Five boy band heartthrobs with demonstrable singing skills began gaining the attention of young people, and Cowell’s label Syco Records signed them to a recording contract.</p><p>One Direction produced "What Makes You Beautiful," their first song to become the UK's number one debut single, and success was knocking on the door for Harry Styles and his bandmates. In 2011, One Direction released their first album (with three songs) and it went on to sell 4.5 million copies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later, One Direction would become huge, create four more albums, and sell more than 70 million records worldwide. The boy band went on a hiatus in 2015, and never reunited for a subsequent album.</p><p>However, during his short span of four years with One Direction, Harry Styles managed to accumulate a net worth of $23 million.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-solo-career-and-his-escalating-net-worth><strong>Harry Styles Solo Career And His Escalating Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Solo Harry Styles gained more fame and wealth; in fact, he is the most successful singer and solo artist associated with One Direction.</p><p>When the three-time Grammy Award winner decided to start his solo career, Columbia Records offered him a whopping $80 million record deal for three albums (and Apple, $25 million). His first solo song "Sign of the Times" came from his debut album Harry Styles, and it gained worldwide appreciation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the success of his first album, the American Music Award winner followed with a second album, Fine Line – which contained emotional and soulful songs, showcasing his ability beyond a boy band. Fine Line sold over five million copies, in an era when people had begun shifting to streaming (rather than purchasing) to access songs.</p><p>Harry Styles' songs have the ability to attract billions of views and millions of followers, and "Watermelon Sugar" from Fine Line brought Harry Styles his first Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance. Harry’s House is his third album, and it brought him to a net worth of $100 million.</p><p>Harry’s House stayed at number one on the UK charts for six weeks, and he won more than three dozen awards for this album – including four Brit Awards, two Grammy Awards, and two American Music Awards.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-39-tours-make-millions><strong>Harry Styles' Tours Make Millions</strong></h2><p>After the dissolution of One Direction, Harry Styles announced Live On Tour, which garnered significant attention. The tour performed well and generated $63 million in ticket sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry Styles's second Love On Tour was a blockbuster too. It commenced in 2021 and concluded in July 2023, becoming the fifth highest-grossing tour of all time, and collecting a staggering sum of $623 million. The show concluded at the RCF Arena (the largest outdoor arena) in Italy, with over 100,000 fans attending that Harry Styles concert.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-39-successful-acting-career><strong>Harry Styles' Successful Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Not content with his successful musical career, Harry Styles set his sights on Hollywood. He had appeared in some documentaries, like One Direction: This Is Us, and Harry Styles: Behind The Album.</p><p>Styles then lucked into the chance to work with the highly regarded director Christopher Nolan, in the movie Dunkirk. The film was a massive hit, and Harry was able to break into the world of film with a serious role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry's boy band background didn't stop Dunkirk from grossing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$500 million at the box office</a>, and he earned $3.4 million for his work on the film. His subsequent role in Don't Worry Darling (directed by his ex Olivia Wilde) was also well-received, and Styles earned $3 million for his lead role in the edgy thriller.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-Scene-From-“Don’t-Worry-Darling”.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>‘Don't Worry Darling’ Film Starring Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Targets $20 Million Debut</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>“The movie takes you on a ride that gets progressively less scintillating as it goes along.”</span><h2 id=harry-styles-39-investments-and-brand-deals><strong>Harry Styles' Investments And Brand Deals</strong></h2><p>In addition to making music and making movies, Harry is consistently in demand with brands; he is the famous <a href=#>luxury brand Gucci's</a> ambassador, another reason he's one of the UK's richest people under the age of 30. Harry has also collaborated with many other fashion brands, like Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent, and the technology brand Apple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Styles also created a beauty brand ... and sold it within hours at a much higher price. Styles has invested in real estate (his North London home is worth $4.8 million dollars), and he purchased a luxurious penthouse in 2017 for $8.7 million.</p><p>According to Elle Decor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles owns real estate properties</a> worth $62.5 million.</p><p>To recap, Harry Styles is a brilliant musician, a skilled actor, and a savvy business person. Styles has an estimated net worth of $150 million in 2023, ranking him high on the list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wealthiest young people in the United Kingdom</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaenYrGqsIyhmKuqqWLAtcXLnqpmmpWYvK6xjKilnmWfm3q1tMRmrKSrXa68trrGnqqtZaearq3Ax6KcrKxdm7aowdGeqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dennis-cole-net-worth-at-death-date-place-and-cause-of-death-family-etc.html><span>←</span><span>Dennis Cole Net Worth at Death, Date, Place and Cause of Death, Family, etc</span></a>
