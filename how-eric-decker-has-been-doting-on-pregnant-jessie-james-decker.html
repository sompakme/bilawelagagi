The couple already share daughter Vivianne, 9, and sons Eric Jr., 7, and Forrest, 5.</p><p>The following month, <a href=#>Jessie dished to&nbsp;<i>Us</i></a> about her fourth pregnancy, revealing, “This baby is definitely taking it easier on me out of all of them.” She added, “Every pregnancy is so different, but it’s been easier. I haven’t had any aversions really. Just been wanting to eat everything as usual.”</p><p>The Kittenish founder confessed that after such a big break after her last pregnancy, she might be “rusty in some places.” As for parenting, however, Jessie told Us in September that she isn’t worried she’s lost her touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pregnant-Jessie-James-Gushes-Over-Eric-Decker-for-Doting-on-Her-Ahead-of-Baby-No-4-He-s-Amazing-2-e1701289701386.jpg><p>“I do feel like those maternal instincts are always there, and I am not afraid of anything once the baby’s here,” she explained. “But I definitely keep having these moments being like, ‘Oh, is that supposed to happen? Oh, I forgot this. Oh, your boobs do let down.’ I don’t have any milk to come out yet, but I can feel that. I feel everything, and it’s all coming back to me.”</p><p>Jessie, who has since confirmed that <a href=#>she’s having another boy</a>, revealed to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;that baby No. 4 will be the family’s last. “Don’t you start asking me about five!” <a href=#>she teased in September</a>. “Because, no way! No, not even a question! No, we’re good with four.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While this pregnancy came as a “surprise” to Jessie and Eric, the country singer can’t imagine her life now without their future child. “<a href=#>I love being a mom</a>,” Jessie gushed. “So, for me, I’m like, ‘I just can’t imagine life without this baby.’ I’m so excited. I’m all in. I’m ready.”</p><p>For more on Jessie and Eric’s dynamic during her fourth pregnancy, watch the exclusive video above — and pick up the latest issue of <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Us Weekly</i></a>, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6disrO1wmabnpubmr9utMCsZJudlaN6pbvToqWgZZ%2BjerG%2BxKClmqakYremv9KinGaikaKytHnDnpqknaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-jazz-correia-and-laurent-divorce-what-happened-between-them.html><span>←</span><span>Did Jazz Correia And Laurent Divorce?
