The mother of two has shared her secrets over the years on how she has managed to age gracefully, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it can be attributed to her Keto diet</a>, which entails reducing your carbohydrate intake while increasing your fat intake. Berry does not eat carbs to maintain her six-pack, including pasta, rice and white bread. According to Women's Health Magazine, Halle Berry's diet daily consists of morning coffee, light soup for lunch, vegetables, and proteins like fish, beef, and chicken for dinner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Monster's Ball star also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">avoids taking any processed sugars</a> and wine due to her diabetes, and it has improved her overall health over the years. “Having that disease has actually made me healthier than many people that I actually know because I’ve always been very mindful of that.”</p><p>To manage her disease, Berry has had to watch what she eats carefully and only takes sweets during her kids' birthdays. “It’s a lot harder than it used to be. As I get older, I am more conscious of what I eat.” The actress has<a href=#> two kids, Nahla Ariela Aubry and Maceo-Robert Martinez</a>, whom she shares with her exes.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/halle-berry-has-been-living-with-an-illness-for-over-30-years-and-most-fans-weren-t-even-aware.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Halle Berry Has Been Living With An Illness For Over 30 Years And Most Fans Weren't Even Aware</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Halle Berry is known for her healthy lifestyle.

The mother of two stands by her routines every morning and night before bed. She broke down the 4-step routine to fans on her Instagram account. Halle Berry begins by cleansing her face, exfoliating, putting on a hydrating face mask, and finishing with a moisturizer and lactic acid serum. One colossal tip she emphasized was remembering the neck when doing the routine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another part of Halle Berry’s secret to aging backward is her daily supplement intake, which includes vitamins and probiotics. During an Instagram Live, the star introduced her followers to Pendulum, a probiotic company where she is the Chief Communication Officer. According to the actor-director, probiotics are a huge part of her diet because they help metabolize her food. She also takes a lot of vitamins to strengthen her body and joked during the live session, “I’m pretty much a pharmacy.”</p><h2 id=halle-berry-got-into-the-best-shape-of-her-life-for-this-327-million-film>Halle Berry Got Into The Best Shape Of Her Life For This $327 Million Film</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/halle-berry-in-john-wick-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from her diet, Halle Berry’s youthful looks come from her <a href=#>unbelievable fitness routine. </a>The Catwoman actress is known for her fit physique and loves spending her free time caring for her body. Berry shares her fitness routines regularly with her over 6 million Instagram followers. She got into the best shape of her life while preparing for John Wick Chapter 3 alongside <strong><a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a></strong>.</p><p>“I’ve never been in the best shape of my life mentally, physically, and it’s all because I got to work with some of the best of the best. So there are wonderful benefits of that.”</p><p>For the role of Wick’s close friend and assassin, Sofia, Halle Berry had to work out twice a day, five days a week, for 90 minutes. According to her <a href=#>fitness trainer, Peter Lee Thomas, Berry trained like an MMA fighter</a> and incorporated everything from skipping rope, dog training, weapons training and fight training. Berry worked so hard working out for the blockbuster film that she broke three of her ribs during stunt training.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/6EA714D6-9DDF-482F-B92F-186670FD11B7.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Halle Berry Broke A Rib Filming With UFC Champion Valentina Shevchenko</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Working with a real UFC fighter like Valentina Shevchenko was no easy task for Halle Berry.</span><p>When Berry is not working out to get ready for a film, she and Thomas prefer to exercise <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 30 minutes daily</a>.

Halle Berry knows this fact very well and has opened up about how the pressures of aging in Hollywood have affected her. But she has never let it push her to the extent of getting work done on her face or any other body part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We have to stop wanting to look like that decade before. We have to stop coveting that. Let it go and embrace it now, and really be okay. It’s easy to say, I guess, but that’s the goal.”</p><p>Halle Berry opened up to Yahoo! Beauty about how hard it is seeing her peers taking the easy route by getting plastic surgery procedures to turn back the years. “It is pressure. When you see everybody around you doing it, you have those moments when you think, ‘To <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stay alive in this business</a>, do I need to do the same thing?’"</p><p>The actress also admitted that she has had thoughts about going under the knife, mostly because there is always someone trying to push her to do it. “It’s almost like crack that people are trying to push you. That’s what I feel like.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the pressure, Halle Berry has remained steadfast over the years about her decision not to get plastic surgery and thinks when you do too much cosmetic stuff to your face, you become somebody else in a way.<strong> “Aging is natural, and that’s going to happen to all of us. I want to always look like myself, even if that’s an older version of myself.” </strong>The mother of two is not looking to get any work done, as she is already actively caring for her mind, body, and soul.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqScmnqjsdGrsGacmZrBbsPOq6KoraRiwKy1zZyYq51dp7y2wMinnGaonJbAtbXCZqquqpeav7p51aKcsGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hank-baskett-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Hank Baskett Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
