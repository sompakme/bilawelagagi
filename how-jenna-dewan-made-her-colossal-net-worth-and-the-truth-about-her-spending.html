It was reported that Dewan might have made from <strong>$20 to $25 million from her divorce settlement</strong>. With a current net worth of $30 million, it is possible that a bulk of her fortune is thanks (mainly) to that settlement. However, given the time that Dewan has been in the entertainment industry, some of those millions were self-made as well.</p><p>Here's how Jenna Dewan made her colossal net worth and the truth about her spending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/channing-tatum-magic-mike-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Channing Tatum Spent Millions Of His Own Money To Make Magic Mike, But Was It Worth It?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Channing Tatum convinced director Steven Soderbergh to invest his own money, along with Tatum's, to make Magic Mike.</span><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong>Jenna Dewan is expecting her second child with her fiance, Steve Kazee. This is her third child, however, as she shares her daughter, Evelyn with ex-husband, Channing Tatum. Dewan and Tatum are in the middle of a legal battle over Dewan claiming she is entitled to more of the money Tatum made for his "Magic Mike" franchise success. While Dewan has received "some" money from Tatum, Dewan claims, via her attorney, that <strong>further compensation is due as a result of the "billions" the franchise made</strong>. How this will impact Dewan's net worth remains to be seen.</p><h2 id=jenna-dewan-started-as-a-dancer-and-actress><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jenna Dewan Started As A Dancer And Actress</span></h2><h3 id=jenna-dewan-was-a-back-up-dancer-for-big-name-celebrities-and-got-her-break-in-step-up>Jenna Dewan was a back-up dancer for big-name celebrities and got her break in Step Up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar52961115-1.jpg><p>Dewan has been dancing ever since she could walk.
