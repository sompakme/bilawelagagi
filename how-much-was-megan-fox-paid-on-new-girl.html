Aside from <a href=#>hot PDAs with Machine Gun Kelly</a>, the actress' filming schedule is also booked until 2022. Trailers for her 2021 films, Till Death, Night Teeth, and Midnight in the Switchgrass, have recently been released and fans couldn't be more excited. They think the Transformers star deserves these new opportunities following her long hiatus caused by a <a href=#>fallout with director Michael Bay</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a while, Fox had only been in low-rated films until she completely disappeared. Then in 2015, <a href=#>she joined the cast of New Girl</a>, a hit TV series starring Zooey Deschanel. It gave fans some hope that they'd finally see her more on screen. However, it turned out to be another dead-end for the actress despite the good reviews. Some started to think that there might have been an issue with her salary. Here's everything we know about her time in filming the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘New Girl’ Fans Are Losing It After Zooey Deschanel Recreates The Show’s Opening In TikTok Debut</a></span></p><h2 id=the-truth-about-casting-megan-fox-in-39-new-girl-39>The Truth About Casting Megan Fox In 'New Girl'</h2><p>Fox was cast as Reagan in season 5 of the show, mainly to fill Zooey Deschanel's spot since she was on maternity leave. "It’s insane to me that such a gorgeous person can be so funny, but I guess we just all have to accept it," said New Girl's executive producer, Liz Meriwether. Apparently, they'd written Reagan with the Jennifer's Body actress in mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve been a fan of her comedic skills since This Is 40 and I’m so excited to have her on the show," Meriwether added. "We had Megan in mind when we wrote this part – she’s the perfect person to come in and shake these guys up." During the 100th episode celebration of the series, Fox revealed that she initially thought there was some "ulterior motive" in hiring her for the part.</p><p>"I thought there must be some ulterior motive. Like they were going to break their first transgender character and they thought it would be funny if it was me," Fox said. At that point, the Passion Play actress had somehow given up on getting producers to see her range. She was constantly boxed in sensual roles following her overnight rise to fame in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Megan Fox And Lindsay Lohan's 'Rivalry'</a></span></p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-salary-in-39-new-girl-39>Megan Fox's Salary In 'New Girl'</h2><p>The exact amount Fox made in New Girl wasn't disclosed to the public. However, as of April 2020, in an article rounding up the cast's net worths, her estimated wealth was about $10 million. But in 2021, Celebrity Net Worth reports that if Fox finalizes her divorce with Brian Austin Green, her estimated net worth will be reduced to $8 million. Deschanel is worth $25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox has been making her own money since she was about 15 years old. Her first film debut was in the 2001 direct-to-DVD movie Holiday in the Sun starring the Olsen twins. But it was in Transformers that Fox really started to earn the big bucks. The first movie made $709.7 million worldwide. The actress earned $800 million from the blockbuster's sequel which broke records when it made $835.2 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What We Know About Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker's Friendship With Megan Fox And Machine Gun Kelly</a></span></p><p>The Rogue star also has some real estate assets that add to her overall wealth. She most likely split the $3.75 million she made with her ex-husband from selling their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood in Los Angeles. They got it in 2009 for $2.95 million. They also sold a couple more properties — one was worth $2.6 million while the other was priced at $1.299 million. In 2016, the former couple also bought a 2-acre property in Malibu for $3.3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-megan-fox-left-39-new-girl-39-after-season-6>Why Megan Fox Left 'New Girl' After Season 6</h2><p>The only reason Fox left New Girl was that her character had run its course. "Nick and Reagan hit it off and form a romantic relationship with one another. Once Jess returned, the story arc for Fox’s character seemed to come to a close," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote Screen Rant</a>. "But was reignited in season 6 - and Nick’s romantic interest in Reagan caused drama between the roommates for 22 episodes." Of course, the return of Deschanel's character, Jess, was also a huge factor.</p><p>Jess was always meant to end up with Nick, and since Reagan wasn't really part of their group, she didn't have any reason to stick around. Her profession as a pharmaceutical rep also required her to travel around. So maybe it was best to write her out of the show to keep it realistic. After all, the series also came to an end in the next season before it got bad like many long-running shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>New Girl: 20 Things That Never Made Sense About Jess & Nick's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3qnu9dmqpqkkafGbrrEsGSgoaKherOxwKCYp2WamruvtcWeqaxlkqSxuns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./examples-of-successful-community-centers.html><span>←</span><span>Examples of successful community centers</span></a>
