Those who have viewed her Bravo reality television series The Rachel Zoe Project&nbsp;are likely aware of this and are aware that she presumably would not want it any other way. Obviously, this is true for so many women around the world, not just Rachel Zoe.&nbsp;Her rise from being one of the <a href=#>top fashion designers</a> to celebrity to brand name at age 50 is really nothing short of phenomenal. This blog will cover the incredible story of how Rachel Zoe became a Hollywood powerhouse and built her empire.</p><h2 id=road-to-becoming-a-brand-marketing-expert>Road To Becoming A Brand Marketing Expert</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zoe's accomplishment places her in the ranks of TV marketing experts like Donald Trump and Emeril Lagasse. In addition to Kiehl, NARS Cosmetics, and Dyson, she debuted her Luxe Rachel Zoe outerwear as well as accessories collection to QVC with her talent for modest grandeur. Since its inception in September 2009, more than 260,000 Luxe products were bought via QVC during the first year only.</p><p>Its first-year achievement had far exceeded everyone's expectations. And her effect on design, from her brand ambassador role at Piperlime to the magazine covers she arranges to the red-carpet outfits she wears during awards season and the merchandise she sells for brands when she wears their items, reminds Zoe of her idol, <a href=#>Anna Wintour</a>.</p><p>Zoe feels that an innovative person's head is continually in motion, whether they design clothing or homes. She has previously disclosed that her gut instinct is 99% accurate. And she wants to have the same interpersonal skills. But about projects, she said she is quite accurate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Pretty Woman's Houses: A Peek Inside Julia Roberts’ Jaw-Dropping Real Estate Portfolio</a></span></p><h2 id=debut-of-rachel-zoe-s-home-decor-endeavors>Debut Of Rachel Zoe’s Home Decor Endeavors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As among the most in-demand designers, Rachel Zoe has a significant impact. With a best-selling book, an innovative clothing line, and The Zoe Report already under her belt, it is difficult to conceive how she could accomplish more. However, 2016 marked the launch of a pop-up shop in the Grove, the Los Angeles shopping paradise.</p><p>Zoe collaborated with <a href=#>Laurel & Wolf</a>, an online interior design company based in Los Angeles, to bring her collection's first brick-and-mortar store to life. Another example of her home decor expertise is her own home. The floors and walls of Zoe's home are made of dark wood, and its shuttered shutters are inviting. An attendant equipped with a walkie-talkie is circling a corner of baby shower presents, which, like the bedroom on the second floor, must remain untouched until the arrival of the baby boy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Johnny Depp's 8 Biggest Brand Endorsements To Date</a></span></p><h2 id=defying-all-the-odds>Defying All The Odds</h2><p>Despite her popularity with the ordinary, fashion experts continue to appreciate her. Rachel Zoe has become a truly outstanding celebrity. She is at least as famous as the individuals she dresses. People just wish they had Rachel Zoe's salary, home, and television show.</p><p>Zoe specializes in balancing both sides of the fashion curve. She once stated that no one wants to remain in the headlines, but it's not a bad place to begin. Certainly, dressing Nicole Richie and Lindsay Lohan not only for red carpet events and parties but also for their evening Starbucks trips, gave Zoe a fast track to fashion VIP status, which was received with skepticism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no doubt, however, that tabloid culture had a direct effect on the public's fashion sense. Who could forget the huge sunglasses worn by every actress in 2005? Or the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Boho attire</a> consisting of the hobo bags, maxi dresses, as well as wedge platforms?</p><p>The secret to Rachel's brilliance is her impeccable judgment and unbridled enthusiasm for fashion. Rachel Zoe's signature style is retro, glamorous, and boho, but she still manages to make her customers appear unique. It is not surprising that Rachel has her own brand as she is her ultimate best advert.</p><h2 id=becoming-a-powerhouse>Becoming A Powerhouse&nbsp;</h2><p>She says with an evident snort, "No." Zoe stated that she has the utmost admiration for ladies like Oprah since their accomplishments are not simple. She believes that people oppose you at every turn; they pull you down as quickly as you rise. In fact, it is more difficult for women.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In light of this, Zoe has no problems admitting that she is a fashion whore. Her success is dependent on this most fundamental principle, neither notoriety nor wealth, but ardor. She stated that she has never been <a href=#>motivated by money</a>; rather, the route and terror have been her motivators. Zoe explains the appearance of her collection with a near-rational intent. She stated that her objective was to make exquisitely cut, opulent garments — classic suits, tuxedo coats, and faux fur — that offer the impression of luxury without the price tag.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Tyler Perry's Fancy Real Estate Portfolio Over The Years</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fashionista</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMq5icoJWheru7xGaZnpuRorJurYypprCdomK5orDYZqCnZZikua3F1qimnWWRo7FurtSio61lmJq%2FbrHMqaCrnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-why-michael-jackson-s-episode-of-the-simpsons-was-pulled-off-air.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Why Michael Jackson's Episode Of The Simpsons Was Pulled Off Air</span></a>
