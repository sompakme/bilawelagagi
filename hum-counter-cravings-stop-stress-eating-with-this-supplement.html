We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Do you feel like no matter how motivated you are, no matter how much meal-prepping you do and no matter how many burpees you power your way through, it’s just never enough? You are not alone. Far from it. There are so many factors in life that can affect your ability to get fit and lose weight, from stressful jobs, to a lack of resources, to your blood sugar levels!</p><p>But how can you control such uncontrollable factors? By letting a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">supplement</a> work its way through them, victoriously bursting through the other side to show you the light at the end of the tunnel. This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Counter Cravings supplement from HUM Nutrition</a> might just be the one to do it for you!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/woman-weight-loss.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Counter Cravings</a> dietary supplement for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a> at HUM Nutrition!</strong></p><p>Counter Cravings claims to have a variety of potential benefits: it may support healthy weight management, boost your mood and metabolism and balance your blood sugar levels. When your blood sugar levels take a dip, you could start craving some snacks you’re not actually hungry for, so this is super important!</p><p>When this vegan supplement was tested on 19 participants over 60 days, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">84% experienced a reduction in body fat</a> percentage and 74% experienced <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>, while food cravings were reduced by nearly half. Reviewers stand by its effectiveness as well, some noting that even though they were initially skeptical, they were “shocked” by the quick results. They say it “really does help the cravings go away.” One even said “its ability to curb [their] cravings is nothing short of wizardry.” They can now “say no to snacks and not bat an eye”!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/woman-eating-healthy.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Counter Cravings</a> dietary supplement for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a> at HUM Nutrition!</strong></p><p>We also love that this supplement takes your mood and stress levels into account, as stress eating is a huge factor when it comes to health hindrances. Over the past year, especially, many of us have indulged more than ever before. We may feel a temporary wave of calmness when we grab that chocolate bar, but what if we were calm enough to not need that relief in the first place? Thanks to ingredients like L-theanine, a favorite for relaxing an anxious mind, we can leave stress eating in the past!</p><p>So, what do you have to do? Simply take one <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Counter Cravings</a> capsule twice a day with your two main meals. Don’t worry about if you tend to eat dinner later at night; these capsules are caffeine-free, so they won’t keep you up at night the way coffee or soda might. It’s so much less effort than having to cook healthy meals or get through a HIIT workout too (though you should still keep up with those!). Grab a bottle today and see the difference it can make in your life — and remember, if you buy any three bottles of HUM supplements, you can save 15%!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Counter Cravings</a> dietary supplement for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a> at HUM Nutrition!</strong></p><p><strong>Looking for more?
