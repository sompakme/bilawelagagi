In fact, Rajskub kicked off her career&nbsp;as a screen actor on comedy shows such as HBO's&nbsp;Mr. Show With Bob and David and&nbsp;The Larry Sanders Show, where she played Mary Lou Collins.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton's Fans Refuse To Buy Into Sarah Silverman's Apology</a></span></p><h2 id=an-unpolished-gem>An Unpolished Gem</h2><p>Rajskub&nbsp;describes her time on these shows as being very defining of what would turn out to be a long and successful career. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking in an interview</a> on the show&nbsp;Couch Surfing,&nbsp;she recalled how much of an unpolished gem she was in those early days.</p><p>"I was very angsty, a little bit dirty, a little chip on my shoulder, art student," she recalled to host&nbsp;Lola Ogunnaike. "Just, happy to be there but... it was weird. It was like out of my depth, but learning as I went."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mary-Lynn-Rajskub-doing-stand-up.jpeg><p>Working alongside Rajskub on Mr. Show and&nbsp;The Larry Sanders Show&nbsp;as well as the 1997 comedy film&nbsp;Who's The Caboose? was Sarah Silverman, who&nbsp;had&nbsp;bounced back strongly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">from her firing</a>&nbsp;on NBC's hit sketch comedy show,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday Night Live (SNL)</a>.</p><p>Unlike Rajskub, no one would be surprised in the least to know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Silverman is a comedian</a>; the craft is her bread and butter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Bob Odenkirk Wants To Apologize To 'SNL' Creator Lorne Michaels</a></span></p><h2 id=remained-star-struck>Remained Star Struck</h2><p>On the Couch Surfing episode, Rajskub&nbsp;reacted to a scene&nbsp;of her and Silverman&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Larry Sanders Show,&nbsp;before recounting to Ogunnaike&nbsp;that she actually&nbsp;shared a room with her co-star in real life. She&nbsp;remembered how despite being roommates with Silverman at the time, she&nbsp;remained star-struck by her more accomplished friend and colleague.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember it was so glamorous, because she would get like take-out food, scripts would be delivered to her. You know, cause she was already in her career. And she would come out and run jokes. And I was just so caught in the headlights, that was all new to me,"&nbsp;Rajskub recalled. "But I just idolized her, it was fantastic!"</p><p>Their paths would end up diverging significantly as their respective careers grew and blossomed. Rajskub of course became a fixture on the more action-centric 24, while Silverman went on to do among other big projects, her own sitcom on Comedy Central,&nbsp;The Sarah Silverman Program.</p><p>This&nbsp;in&nbsp;no way served to dampen their friendship, however, as was demonstrated recently in a pleasant exchange on Twitter. Rajskub&nbsp;posted a tweet promoting a new special that she had uploaded on her website and tagged Silverman on the tweet, highlighting that she still idolized her, alongside a number of love heart emojis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p dir=ltr lang=en></p><p>Silverman responded in kind, writing, "Love you Mare WATCH HER SPECIAL!!!"</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Vanessa Bryant’s Friendship With Ciara</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6uZmbJuucCrsGakqaO7br7Ao6qkrZJirq%2BwjKyYq5mYYsCquNWeqaaZnqh6trrIqqyeZZantqa6w6yfoqhf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-what-she-has-to-say.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What She Has To Say</span></a>
