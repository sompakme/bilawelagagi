After <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kendall and Devin Booker's relationship</a> ended, it wasn't long before people started talking about her new beau: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bad Bunny</a>.</p><p>It has been several months since people first began talking about Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny, whose <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>music</strong></a> has blown up the charts for a couple of years now. Although the couple has been linked since February 2023, neither has ever said that they are definitely dating. There are some fans who aren't quite sure that this is a real romance. These fans have been very vocal when sharing their opinions on Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-do-fans-believe-kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-have-a-fake-relationship>Why Do Fans Believe Kendall Jenner And Bad Bunny Have A Fake Relationship?</h2><p>Whenever a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family seems to be in a new relationship, everyone wants to know every possible detail. Some of the family members, like Kourtney Kardashian, are very open about their romantic lives. Kourtney has shared a lot of her romance with Travis Barker on Instagram and on the Hulu series The Kardashians.</p><p>Others, like Kendall Jenner, tend to be more secretive about who they're dating. That, of course, leads to some rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/has-kendall-jenner-ever-actually-been-to-a-bad-bunny-concert_-1.jpg><p>Ever since fans read news articles saying that Kendall and Bad Bunny were a couple, some people began posting online and saying that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kendall and Bad Bunny's relationship is fake</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Kardashian-Jenner Family Net Worth Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><p>A fan started a thread in the SubReddit Pop Culture Chat and wrote, "Who else thinks Bad Bunny and Kendall is just a publicity stunt?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Redditor @Snoo46478 wrote, "I think the timing of their 'relationship' getting leaked was interesting." They continued, "They both have a lot to gain. He’s already a crossover, but this could cement his career in a huge way and make him visible to a new audience. Thoughts?"</p><p>The majority of responses said that Bad Bunny could become more successful and famous as a result of dating Kendall Jenner. One Redditor posted that four months ago, when there was a lot of press about the relationship, Bad Bunny was preparing to perform at Coachella.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52675786.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Redditor wrote, "The kind of people who follow and adore the KarJenners, Biebers etc. are the type who attend Coachella for the ~vibes~ and aesthetic, so I bet it’s all wrapped up in that."</p><p>Others said that Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner are friends who spend time together, but they don't believe they are actually romantically involved. Redditor @youknowjustthere wrote, "it could be pr, it could be real, but i do think it isn’t heading towards relationship, just two hot people hanging out."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Has Kendall Jenner Ever Actually Been To A Bad Bunny Concert?</a></span></p><p>In another Reddit thread, several people discussed the rumor that Kylie Jenner was dating Timothee Chalamet. A few people posted that in their opinion, that wasn't a real relationship, and neither is Kendall and Bad Bunny's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Redditor wrote, "Bad Bunny and Timothee are signed to the same PR agency and are both dating Jenners. Make of that what you will." Another posted that fans learned that both sisters were in relationships again when the next season of The Kardashians premiered. They wrote, "Of course it's fake PR nonsense. It's not a coincidence that they both got new partners right before season 3 aired."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bad-bunny-looking-very-happy.jpg><p>However, there is no proof that Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny's relationship is all about PR. While some people believe that they are pretending to be interested in each other in order to find more career success, this is just speculation on the part of several fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's true that Kendall Jenner is incredibly famous and so are her family members, that doesn't necessarily mean that is why Bad Bunny is dating her. There's also no evidence to support that Kendall Jenner doesn't actually care about Bad Bunny and that she wants to use his fame for her own purposes.</p><h2 id=what-did-kendall-jenner-say-about-her-relationship-with-bad-bunny>What Did Kendall Jenner Say About Her Relationship With Bad Bunny?</h2><p>Kendall Jenner hasn't come out and said that she is dating Bad Bunny. But she was asked about him when she was interviewed for The Wall Street Journal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-18.jpg><p>When Kendall said, “no comment," she said, "I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side. Does that make sense?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued to The Wall Street Journal, "I’ll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that’s the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Justin Bieber Really Date Kendall Jenner?</a></span></p><p>In the past, the celebrity didn't say that much about who she was dating. However, in September 2021, she was on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and said that her now ex-boyfriend Devin Booker was close with her family. She said, “He loves them. Him and Stormi have an amazing relationship. She has the biggest crush on him, and I’m jealous sometimes. I’m like, ‘Stop — can you guys not?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/is-bad-bunny-and-kendall-jenner-s-relationship-a-pr-stunt_-why-some-fans-think-it-s-fake.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Kendall has said that she doesn't want to say a ton about her relationships, it's likely that she felt comfortable talking about Booker because they had been together for a while at that point. If she and Bad Bunny stay together, she might say something in the future. But until they become more committed to each other, fans might not hear much from her.</p><p>Even if Kendall Jenner isn't talking about Bad Bunny, many sources have spoken to the media, and they have shared how she feels about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bad-bunny-movie-premiere.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2023, a source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">talked about Kendall and Bad Bunny's relationship</a> in an interview with People. They said, "it was a slow start, but they spend almost every day together now. He hangs out with her friends and she hangs out with his. It's more of a relationship now. Kendall is not seeing anyone else. She really likes him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWSlrFurtSnpbJlkaOxbrfEp5uapJxit6a6zZ6prGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6onnPq2SsrKWjwW6ywKeqZqyYnrusecitqmaekaCycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grifgreen20-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Grifgreen20 Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
