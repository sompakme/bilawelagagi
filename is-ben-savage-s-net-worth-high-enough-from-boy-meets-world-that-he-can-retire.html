<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Is Ben Savage's Net Worth High Enough From Boy Meets World That He Can Retire?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Ben Savage became a household name as a result of a hit show being brought to the Friday night lineup of TGIF on ABC. His show, Boy Meets World, with co-stars <a href=#>Danielle Fishel, with whom there was a brief romance</a>, Will Friedle, and <a href=#>Rider Strong, who initially wanted nothing to do with the show</a>, was a coming-of-age show in the two-hour time block that was reserved for 30-minute comedies that would bring parents and adults together for wholesome family programming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For seven years, Boy Meets World was one of the top shows for the tween to teenage demographic that executives were trying to reach. After Boy Meets World ended, Savage made the decision to attend college to live a life that was a far different cry than that of being in the spotlight in Hollywood. During this time, the Girl Meets World star dabbled in the political world, choosing to major in political science. This led him to a Washington, DC internship where a love of politics was born.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rider Strong And Ben Savage "Didn't Get Along That Well" When Boy Meets World First Began</a></span></p><p>Once he graduated from Stanford, Savage returned to the small screen to star in Girl Meets World with several of his old co-stars from Boy Meets World. Instead of the show revolving around what Savage's character experienced, it now revolved around his character's daughter, Riley. The show was a hit but was canceled after three seasons while at the height of its success to go out with a bang.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After this stint on the small screen, Savage was not able to get cast in the roles that led to long-term series success. As such, he was having to rely on his earnings from his earlier success to survive. But is Ben Savage's net worth high enough from Boy Meets World to retire?</p><h2 id=ben-savage-became-famous-thanks-to-39-boy-meets-world-39>Ben Savage Became Famous Thanks To 'Boy Meets World'</h2><p>Savage was a bona fide childhood actor. He started his career by acting in commercials and landing guest spots in popular television shows of the 1980s as well as made-for-TV movies. However, it was not until Savage landed the role of Cory Matthews on Boy Meets World that he became a star.</p><p>Before Boy Meets World joined TGIF, there had been several years of ABC executives working out the kinks for their family-friendly show lineup. As such, by 1993, the Friday night shows brought in the highest viewership of the major networks. With the addition of Boy Meets World and its homage to classic television sitcoms, ABC would hold that title for years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar46566816.png><p>Given that tens of millions of viewers were tuning in, it meant that when Savage was not filming he would be approached by fans. For some actors, this sounds like a nightmare. But for Savage, he enjoyed interacting with those who helped make him a star. A fact he made clear when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked point-blank about whether he liked his fans</a>.</p><p>"I love 'em! They keep me employed...," Savage explained. "But on top of that, it always makes me feel so special when people come up to me on the street and tell me that they enjoy the show -- it's like I am contributing to their happiness, and I love that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Ben Savage Really Thinks About Cory And Topanga Ending Up Together</a></span></p><p>As a result of his popularity and the fact that Boy Meets World ended while it was still at the top of the rating game, Savage made quite a bit of money from the show.</p><p>How much exactly is not known. But given that this is where Savage spent most of his acting career, it would make sense that the 30-minute sitcom was where most of his fortune came from.</p><h2 id=ben-savage-is-worth-8-million>Ben Savage Is Worth $8 Million</h2><p>Having worked as an actor since 1985, Savage has managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amass an $8 million fortune</a>. While it is much smaller than some actors who have been in the business as long, in comparison to the rest of the Boy Meets World cast, Savage is worth the most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar46101357-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is interesting to point out is that in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Savage was worth an estimated $12 million</a>. That is quite a big difference from his current net worth. It could have to do with the fact that after Girl Meets World ended in 2017, Savage had a hard time landing acting roles that were as lucrative as his past gigs.</p><p>It could also be that he stopped doing appearances at conventions, which are also known to be good moneymakers for former teen stars.</p><p>Savage's lack of acting and his foray into politics could have contributed to the loss of income.</p><p>While it is unknown what Savage spent to run, and ultimately lose, his campaign for a West Hollywood council seat, that number is likely peanuts compared to what Savage has in mind now that he has all but retired from Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-ben-savage-retire-from-hollywood-with-his-millions>Did Ben Savage Retire From Hollywood With His Millions?</h2><p>The last acting gig that Savage landed was a Lifetime movie in 2022, Girl in the Shed: The Kidnapping of Abby Hernandez. Before that, it was a Hallmark Hanukkah movie. And while actors are generally paid well for these acting jobs, they do not compare to what Savage was making years before on Boy Meets World.</p><p>As such, this could have been the catalyst Savage needed to move forward with his political career. And this time, he has his sights set higher than a city council seat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ben-savage.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In March 2023, Savage announced that he was running for Congress</a>; specifically, to fill a seat in the US House of Representatives that will be vacant with the announcement that Rep. Adam Schiff is running for Senate in 2024.</p><p>Unfortunately, given his lack of communication with his co-stars from Boy Meets World, <a href=#>he may not have their support</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I am a proud Californian, union member and longtime resident of District 30 who comes from a family of unwavering service to our country and community," Savage explained. "I firmly believe in standing up for what is right, ensuring equality and expanding opportunities for all."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will Friedle's Career Almost Ended After Boy Meets World, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>If Savage wins, then he will be getting a decent size salary that will help him live the quality of life he has been used to over the last decade or more, much like <a href=#>Caroline Sunshine who also left acting for politics</a>.</p><p>His days with Hollywood will be over, and perhaps, larger political offices await the political hopeful previously known as Cory Matthews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqZdqK63rcaeZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-don-vito-make-latest-don-vito-net-worth-income-salary.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Don Vito Make?
