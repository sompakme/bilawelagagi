In February 2016 the two made their red carpet debut at the Grammy Awards. However, by November of that year Hadid and The Weekend parted ways, but not for long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>​​​​</p><p>By late 2017, Bella Hadid and The Weekend rekindled their romance, but this time around they kept their relationship a lot more private — at least for a while. A few months in, they began sharing their romance on social media again, giving their followers insight into where they are and what they're up to.</p><p>While the couple was together for over a year, by August 2019 they seem to have called it quits again. At the time, Entertainment Tonight reported that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two are still trying to work things out</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="10 Songs Of The Weeknd That Were About His Love Interests (And Whom Were They About)">10 Songs Of The Weeknd That Were About His Love Interests (And Whom Were They About)</a></span></p><p>"The couple travels a lot, works a lot and that often creates tension. However, the two love one another, have lost one another in the past and want to try and make it work," a source told the outlet. "Right now they are together and working on keeping it that way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to E!, it was their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">busy schedules that caused them to part ways</a> — but it's no secret that most celebrity breakups tend to use this as the official reason.</p><p>"They are in different places right now, physically and mentally. Bella is prepping for her fashion week commitments and Abel is working on his music and his upcoming acting debut," the source said. "They have been arguing a lot recently. [They] haven't spent quality time together in months."</p><h2 id=how-long-have-bella-hadid-and-marc-kalman-been-together>How Long Have Bella Hadid And Marc Kalman Been Together?</h2><p>According to Who's Dated Who, Bella Hadid and Marc Kalman have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating since 2020</a>. Grazia writes that the couple has been together at least since July 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source for Page Six revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two were first spotted together out in public around the time</a>, but "most of the time they were with other people, which of course made it difficult to prove that they were dating."</p><p>Since then, the couple became slightly more public, but they still keep their relationship under the radar. However, the two have since shared glimpses into their life together on Instagram.</p><h2 id=this-is-why-bella-hadid-keeps-her-relationship-private>This Is Why Bella Hadid Keeps Her Relationship Private</h2><p>In an interview with Vogue, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Hadid opened up about why she chooses to keep her relationship out of the spotlight</a>. "I think that’s why things have been able to last," the model said, contrasting her highly publicized relationship with The Weeknd. "When you give other people room to have opinions on things that are so personal to you, it poisons it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, Bella Hadid managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hide her relationship with Marc Kalman for an entire year</a>. A source for Page Six revealed just what lengths the couple went to so that they wouldn't be spotted together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Bella Hadid Shocks Fans With A Smooching Photo Of New Beau, Marc Kalman">Bella Hadid Shocks Fans With A Smooching Photo Of New Beau, Marc Kalman</a></span></p><p>"They hid it well," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the insider said</a>. "If they went out, he would come out first, get the car, and then she would get into the car. They would drive to a location, and he’d drop her off but not get out and go park the car. They were very diligent about not being seen on a public street at the same time."</p><p>The Page Six source added that the couple came out to the public around the time of their one-year anniversary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Bella Hadid and Marc Kalman certainly aren't hiding their relationship anymore, the model definitely isn't as open about it as she was with The Weeknd. The damage that publicity brought to her relationship with the Canadian musician seems to have taught the model that it's best to keep some things private.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqSclnqprcOim2aan66zs7XEp5tmpZGnsG63wKWkmqZdqbWmedaenKSmlGK1qr%2FTqKmyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-rid-of-a-jd-byrider-car.html><span>←</span><span>How to get rid of a jd byrider car</span></a>
