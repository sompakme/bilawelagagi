Wasn’t that much of a change. Right now, I’m just working on redefining who I am. They don’t want to change anything about me, they believe if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. They want me to be the best that I can be, they want me to be myself.”</p><h2 id=h-jade-cargill-the-coaches-are-amazing>Jade Cargill: The Coaches Are Amazing</h2><p>Jade Cargill went on to emphasize that she is being herself with everything she is doing. She also spoke highly of the coaches, as she noted that they want her to thrive.</p><p>“Literally, what you see, what I’m doing with these promos and everything I’m doing, it’s me,” she said. “It’s literally just me, and they want me to just be me and go out there. So I don’t know. The coaches are so amazing. They want to see me do well, they want to see me excel. They’ll pull me to the side if they see something that is something I need to work on and critique. No issues at all.”</p><p>The interview can be seen here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Click <a href=#>here</a> to see what Jade Cargill had to say about potentially competing at WrestleMania 40.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtanJuZmK3orDEZpqaqpeeua151rCcZq%2BRo8G0ecyeZK2nXZeybrnEZqCmZaekv6y1zaBkqKZdp7KlscWipaKml2LEqbuMomSapQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-what-their-relationship-was-like.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What Their Relationship Was Like</span></a>
