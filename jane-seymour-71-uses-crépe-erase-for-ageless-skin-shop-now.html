When we look at Emmy-winning actress <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jane Seymour</strong></a>, we see a youthful, gorgeous, talented woman. She is all of the above, of course, but her actual age always comes as a shock. Who would guess this clear-skinned goddess is actually 71 years old?</p><p>The iconic Bond girl and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman star is effortlessly proving that being in your 70s doesn’t have to mean looking “old.” But how does she do it? With a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">brand</a> you can nab for yourself, straight from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Crépe Erase Body Firm Advanced Body Repair Treatment</a> at Amazon!</strong></p><p>Seymour, a partner of Crépe Erase, recently posted about the brand on her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “The single most asked question I receive is “how do you get your skin looking so good?” she wrote in her caption. “Each time I tell them, it’s a combination of eating healthy and fresh as well as my @crepeerase!”</p><p>In the photo, the fresh-faced actress posed with the brand’s popular anti-aging body products, including the famous <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Body Firm Advanced Body Repair Treatment</a>, which has loads of stellar reviews on Amazon. It’s a dermatologist-tested, fragrance-free cream made with the brand’s exclusive TruFirm Complex, made with naturally-derived ingredients like apple, dill and sage!</p><p>This TruFirm Complex is designed to support natural collagen and elastin production. Collagen is so important when it comes to supple, youthful skin. As reported in the <a href=# rel=noopener>National Library of Medicine</a>, “Collagen will be used without any doubt for effective rejuvenating treatments of an aging population”!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Crépe Erase Body Firm Advanced Body Repair Treatment</a> at Amazon!</strong></p><p>This treatment also claims to provide 48 hours of hydration to the skin, featuring nine “super hydrators.” Coconut oil, vitamin E, a glyceride trio, cocoa butter, squalene, olive oil and grapeseed oil are the ingredients to thank!</p><p>Consistent use of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this cream</a> could lead to smoother, firmer, softer skin. It may also form a protective barrier against environmental aggressors on skin, thanks to its antioxidant properties. Just apply up to two times per day after exfoliating. Focus on dry, crépey areas of the skin, massaging in upward, circular motions until absorbed. Need a good exfoliator to complete your routine?
