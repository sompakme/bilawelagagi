Janet wore the all-black outfit, which included black patent leather pants and a textured, bubble shirt, during her 1995 collaboration with her late brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jackson</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">First Ellen DeGeneres NFT Up For Auction, All Profits To Be Donated</a></span></p><p>Similarly, the military jacket she dawned in the video from “Rhythm Nation” earned a cool $81,250. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gulf Today</a> notes that the jacket, which was scooped up on Friday, sold for more than 20 times what it was expected to go for ($4,000-6,000). The identity of the buyer hasn't been revealed to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was originally reported that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pop star agreed to auction off over 1,000 pieces</a> of personal memorabilia last month, including various costumes she wore on tour and to events. Janet partnered with celebrity auctioneer Julien in order to host the three-day sale in Beverly Hills, which started on Friday (May 14th) and ends today on Sunday (May 16th). The auction was held in part to honor Janet’s legendary career as well as to mark her 55th birthday, which happens to be the day the sale ends. A portion of the proceeds made from the auction are being donated to charitable organization Compassion International.</p><p>In conjunction with the auction, Janet also put a selection of her costumes and memorabilia on display. The rare exhibition began on April 19th at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hard Rock Café</a> in London and lasted for five days before the exhibit was moved to New York and finally Los Angeles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many other notable pieces found new homes thanks to the auction. The wedding dress that Janet wore to her married to dancer René Elizondo Jr. was among the items auctioned off. Janet and René were married from 1991 to 2000 after tying the knot in secret. A pair of silver-tone hoop earrings were sold for $43,750, while a metallic silver coat designed by Helen Storey went for $50,000. One thing that was missing from the auction, however, was the black leather bustier Janet wore during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime, which infamously ripped and exposed her breasts.</p><p>Janet has even more in store for fans in the near future! A two-part documentary exploring the musician’s life is set to debut sometime next year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> confirms. The documentary will be titled JANET and is being released in honor of the 40th anniversary of Janet’s self-titled debut album, which came out in 1982. It’ll premiere on Lifetime and A&E.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice Cooper To Auction Rare Andy Warhol Painting Through Arizona Gallery</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gulf Today</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3orrErWSjmZOgwLC6jKyaq52RonqztNitn6ZlnpbBqrvNZpium6SevK950qijnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flavor-flav-reveals-family-ties-with-wu-tang-clan-members.html><span>←</span><span>Flavor Flav Reveals Family Ties With Wu-Tang Clan Members</span></a>
