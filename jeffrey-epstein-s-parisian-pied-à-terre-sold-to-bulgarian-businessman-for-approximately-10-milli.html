Indeed, according to one of Epstein’s employees, England’s Prince Andrew was a regular visitor to Epstein’s Paris apartment. The employee allegedly <a href=#>to</a>l<a href=#>d</a> investigators, “He often stayed with us here, even when Mr. Epstein wasn’t in residence. I took Andrew out in the evenings and looked after him as well as I could. He loved my pasta-and-cheese bake.” (Andrew has long maintained he did not know about Epstein’s debased proclivities or engage in any illicit activity with underage young women.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Guests first pass through the building’s imposing wrought-iron gates, leafy courtyard and opulent lobby before being ushered into Epstein’s sophisticated lair, a roughly 7,500-square-foot amalgamation of two (or more) apartments on the building’s noble floor that were combined, renovated and restored for Epstein by famed Moroccan-born and Paris-based interior designer Alberto Pinto. The noble floor of a building typically sits on the second floor above street level, often with rich detailing and extra-high ceilings.</p><p>While digital listings and images have been largely scrubbed from the internet, reports from when the apartment was first put up for sale show impeccably maintained rooms that showcase a curious mélange of unusual objét and artworks amid comfortable furnishings covered in a rich array of plush fabrics. With soaring 16-plus-foot ceilings, the quartet of reception rooms includes a double living room and a rotunda lounge positioned in the southwest prow of the building, where it has a stunning view down Avenue Foch toward the Arc de Triomphe. There’s also a dining room and a study, the latter of which has walls are clad in huge tufted panels of red leather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depending on how rooms are used, there can be up to seven bedrooms, according to marketing material, and though it is unclear if Mr. Pinto had a hand in its design, the apartment’s creepiest feature might just to be the specially built massage room. The offering included two pint-sized staff apartments tucked up into the building’s upper floors, one about four hundred square feet, the other just half that.</p><p>Epstein died in 2019, an apparent suicide, while in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. A lawyer for the disgraced financier’s executors told Bloomberg that Epstein’s estate had paid out $121 million to 136 persons who accused him of abuse and that additional proceeds from the liquidation of Epstein’s remaining assets, including the sale of the Paris apartment, are earmarked as potential compensation for future claims against the estate from Epstein’s victims.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to a collection of “bizarre and creepy” artworks, which allegedly include a painting of Bill Clinton wearing a dress, Epstein’s assets once included an extensive portfolio of lavish and eccentric homes. His Manhattan townhouse, a 51,000-square-foot behemoth on East 71st Street, acquired decades ago under somewhat mysterious circumstances from billionaire retailer Leslie Wexner, was sold in 2021 for $51 million to former Goldman Sachs honcho Michael K. Daffey, and his Palm Beach residence was purchased by developer Michael Glaser in early 2021 for $18.5 million. The El Brillo Way home was quickly razed, and Glaser sold the freshly vacant waterfront parcel later the same year for almost $26 million to venture capitalist David Skok.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico was initially put up for sale in July 2021 at $27.5 million; with no takers, the price of the 8,000-acre property now stands at a hugely reduced $18 million. And finally, his two private islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Great St. James and Little St. James, are now listed at $110 million after first coming to market at $125 million. A recent $105 million settlement to resolve racketeering claims brought by the Caribbean island’s government also stipulates that half the proceeds of the sale of the smaller island will be granted to the government.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Bloomberg</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajnZabv6bFjJ6nrKyVnru0ec%2BaqaKrmZa7brzInptmmV2psrO%2BxGaqqKSUYsGwecGuo6CZop6ur3nBrqqippWowK6tzWadqKpdlr2xvs6xoKaZpJq5unmQaWSmoZyhtrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hunter-parrish-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Hunter Parrish Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
