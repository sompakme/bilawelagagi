This is what I’m gonna do? OK. This was a great idea.’”</p><p>However, she added, after seeing it, the scene really worked and fans still really love it.</p><p>“Every Halloween, I’ll be wherever with friends in different neighborhoods and somebody will have a little too much of something while they’re trick or treating and they’ll come around the corner and be like, ‘What are you waiting for, huh?’ I’m like, ‘Not you buddy, keep moving.
