But it’s funny — I guess we’re at the point where anything is believable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jimm-kimmel-valentines-day-cards-02.jpg><p>The late-night host then went through a list of the cards, which he jokingly said were available on the White House official website. “The best seller comes from President Trump himself, his card says: ‘I flip for you!’” Kimmel said, showing a photo of POTUS with his hair flapping in the wind.</p><p>“The White House categorically denies it is Valentine’s Day… No more questions,” Sanders’ card read. White House advisor and speech writer Stephen Miller’s card also caused some groans from the audience. The card read: “I wanna have your children… deported!”</p><p>Kimmel also took the opportunity to recall First Lady <strong>Melania Trump</strong>’s 2016 Republican National Convention speech, which at the time received backlash for being strikingly similar to Michelle Obama’s 2008 speech. “Melania has a good card,” Kimmel said. “Melania wrote, ‘Whatever Michelle Obama said last Valentine’s Day.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kimmel’s roast of the administration comes as no surprise. He’s been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and of the Republican health care bill after his 9-month-old son, <a href=#>Billy, underwent heart surgery</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGipZ2ueqy1zKacpWWdpLCsscNmq6utnaV6orDMoqWiq6SnrrW1zqdksKGknXq3rcuepa2hnprAbrDAsmScmaKZwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-close-are-new-girl-stars-jake-johnson-and-max-greenfield.html><span>←</span><span>How Close Are 'New Girl' Stars Jake Johnson And Max Greenfield?</span></a>
