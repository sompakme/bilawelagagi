Valued at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$23.95 million</a>, this house is covered wall to wall in the most lavish decor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen & John Legend Cut $6 Million Off Mansion Price</a></span></p><p>Promoting her highly anticipated third cookbook, Cravings, Teigen took to Instagram Live to teach her fans how to make the perfect red lintel soup. The cooking session quickly turned into an episode of Million Dollar Listings, as her Grammy winning husband took over the camera to show off their dazzling spot.</p><p>Starting with the massive living room, we see their 2 year old son, Miles chilling out on their huge white couch, overlooking a posh wooden TV cabinet shipped all the way from Thailand. The cozy sitting area contains a pastel pink armchair and another ornate looking leather chair.</p><p>From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the same angle</a>, fans got a sneak peak of the backyard. Though, since the couple had just finished renovating the insides, Legend admitted that the vacant outside was a work in progress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The center piece of the open area is without a doubt the towering, indoor plant that the couple dubbed '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the tree of life'</a>. The tree is in honor of the couple's late son who passed away during birth complications. At the base of the tree is a beautiful frame that's etched with various, golden illustration flora and fauna.</p><p>"We dedicated this to baby Jack and it’s really beautiful. We were inspired by our friend Kelly Wearstler’s house," Legend explains during the live, "she has a tree in the middle of it – and we thought it would be cool to have one."</p><p>Teigen discussed more of the spiritual weight the tree holds in a conversation with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's important for us in Thai tradition that we always embrace the ones we've lost, and they're never, ever gone," the model says, "This tree being planted inside the home, the whole reason why I wanted it was so Jack's ashes could be in that soil and he could be with us all the time and grow through the beautiful leaves in this tree."</p><p>The family room -the place the couple says that they spend their time - was also featured in the live tour. Sunlight cascaded into the room through the huge floor to ceiling windows. Glamorous, creamed colored loveseats were adorned with dozens of throw pillows. It seems like the perfect spot to relax after a long day as Legend says, "If we're watching Real Housewives, it's mostly in here."</p><p>The rest of the magnificent estate has to be left up to our imagination. Amenities of the home like its saltwater infinity pool, since cellar, and opulent&nbsp;fireplace were not displayed in the live. Though fans were more than lucky to get a glimpse at this amazing estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <a href=#>The Ways John Legend Earns And Spends His $80 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNZqOen5WjsW6vx6ugrKupYsGmtcaepWarnpqurHnPnpikZaKau7DCwK2cnWWYpLqmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chingy-thanks-chris-brown-for-bringing-right-thurr-back-to-life.html><span>←</span><span>Chingy Thanks Chris Brown For Bringing Right Thurr Back To Life</span></a>
