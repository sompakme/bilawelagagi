The actor is apparently eyeing an Italian castle that would set him back a cool $4 million.</p><p>The regal estate is situated in a small town, Montalto Dora, Italy, with only 3,000 inhabitants, making it the perfect getaway for the celebrity, assuming he wants to avoid paparazzi and fans. Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources tell TMZ Depp is interested in the castle</a>, he hasn’t put in an official offer.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Revisiting Johnny Depp's Highest-Grossing 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' Films</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pirates Of The Caribbean plundered $4.5 billion across five films. Johnny Depp may reignite the franchise - amid murky waters.</span><p>Part of what’s holding Depp back may be the reaction from the locals, as they’re apparently not keen on the idea of the acting legend moving into town, especially given the hoopla surrounding the legal battle with his ex-wife Amber Heard, which he settled last year after years of abuse claims.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny likely spent a pretty penny on legal fees pertaining to his defamation case against Heard – even she admits she went bankrupt after the years-long case. For both celebs, it did some big damage to their reputation and careers, with Depp reportedly losing $26 million on a potential new Pirates of the Caribbean franchise after Disney let him go amid the controversy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-17-at-8-44-31-am.png><p>But since Depp came out on the winning side of the case, his career has seen an upwards turn as well as his net worth. He premiered his latest film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeanne du Barry </a><a href=#>last year this year to critical acclaim</a>. The actor often makes tens of millions for his acting gigs, and this role was likely no different. It had been Depp’s first film in three years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also maintained his multi-million-dollar campaign with Dior. Last year, he re-signed with the brand in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">record-setting deal reportedly worth $20 million</a> , making it the most expensive men’s fragrance deal of the time.</p><p>Needless to say, the $4 million price tag on the Italian castle likely isn’t a huge expense for the multi-millionaire, but it could be his potential neighbours keeping him from closing the deal. Depp already has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">large real estate portfolio to his name</a>, including homes in Hollywood Hills, England, France, and Kentucky. He even reportedly owns his own island in the Bahamas, which he bough tin 2004 for a little under $4 million after finding it while filming Pirates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmo6eYo7u6ecOep6llnKS8rL%2BMm6yyZWRiuqq4y6Kmp2WZqa6ttcCnZJyZo6m5pnnCmqmenaJisLC5xJuYnKNf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-bullard-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>James Bullard Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
