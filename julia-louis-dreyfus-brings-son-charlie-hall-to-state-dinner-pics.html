The<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Sex Lives of College Girls&nbsp;</i></a>actor, for his part, looked dapper in a black tuxedo and bowtie.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Thunderbolts&nbsp;</i>star</a> and her son were among the coveted guests at <a href=#><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> </a>and wife<a href=#><strong> Dr. Jill Biden</strong></a>’s soirée. The Thursday gathering was hosted in honor of special guests French President <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> and his wife, <strong>Brigitte Macron</strong>, after they arrived in the United States for <a href=#>an official state visit</a>.</p><p class=p1>Charlie has been <a href=#>following in his mom’s acting footsteps</a> since 2019. The former basketball player landed the role of Essex College student Andrew on <a href=#>season 2 of&nbsp;<i>Sex Lives of College Girls</i></a>, which began airing on HBO Max last month.</p><p class=p1>“It means that my children now really respect what I do for a living,” Louis-Dreyfus gushed to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;</i>in September of watching her son’s newfound career. “He’s really digging being an actor and he’s really good. Good on him.”</p><p class=p1>When the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Seinfeld</a>&nbsp;</i>alum told the outlet that <a href=#>Charlie has asked his mom for acting tips</a>, she revealed her No. 1 advice. “Get out of the business,” she quipped to&nbsp;<i>ET&nbsp;</i>at the time.</p><p class=p1>Louis-Dreyfus was <a href=#>equally proud of Charlie’s athletic tenure</a> when he was <a href=#>a college student at Northwestern University</a> in Chicago, where she seldom missed his games.</p><p class=p1>“My younger son is a basketball player,” the&nbsp;<i>Falcon and the Winter Soldier&nbsp;</i>alum said during a&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;</i></a>appearance in April 2017. “You know, it’s the thing with the ball? And so, it has been a thrilling ride because — for those of you who don’t know — Northwestern got into the [NCAA] tournament for the first time in the school’s history.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “I’ve got two children and all my life, <a href=#>I’ve gone to every game</a>, every concert, everything they did. I have to say, I’m watching them and I just do that because you’re the mom.”</p><p class=p1>While Charlie <a href=#>has been aware of his mother’s fame</a>, he tried not to let that impact his performance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I’m definitely hearing about it a little bit. My friends are texting me because I’m on TV a little more, too,” the&nbsp;<i>Sweethearts&nbsp;</i>actor joked to the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Salt Lake Tribune</a>&nbsp;</i>in March 2017 before an NCAA match. “The work ethic you put into [the game] is going to help me outside of school, whatever work I decide to go into after basketball. It’s something that can be easily applied to any profession. And being around these guys is amazing.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see photos from Louis-Dreyfus’ night out with her youngest son:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt7a4yJpkpaelnsBusNGesJ%2Bto2Kvs7XNoKpmq5%2BjeqS0wKujop1dna6tuIytpmarpJbBpnnDoqWnnaJivaqv0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-james-decker-brings-husband-kids-on-thanksgiving-parade-float.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie James Decker Brings Husband, Kids on Thanksgiving Parade Float</span></a>
