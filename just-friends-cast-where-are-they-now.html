The cast of Just Friends has kept audiences laughing for more than 15 years after the film — which showed Ryan Reynolds as overweight teen-turned-womanizer, Chris Brander — initially hit theaters in 2005.
In the rom-com, Chris is reunited with his high school best friend, Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart), after finding himself stuck at home for the holidays.
When Chris’s flight to Paris with singer Samantha James (Anna Faris) gets rerouted to New Jersey following a plane fire, he is forced to face his former crush — who told him as a teenager that she wasn’t interested in him romantically — and another high school pal, Dusty Dinkleman (Chris Klein), who also loved Jamie."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
