He has a staggering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $240 million. However, he's also dishing out the cash. In 2016, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a> himself $53 million in debt.

It was taken directly after the star was&nbsp;discovered dead in her bathtub.</p><p>Legend Whitney Houston struggled with drug abuse and was&nbsp;tragically&nbsp;discovered drowned in her bathtub in 2012. Cocaine and heart disease was thought to be the underlying factors. West&nbsp;paid&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$85,000</a>&nbsp;to secure the right to license to this&nbsp;haunting&nbsp;image, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> Pusha T that&nbsp;it was “what people need to see to go along with this music.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=private-jet-200-000-per-hour>Private Jet: $200,000 per hour</h2><p>Next time you're squeezed into a tiny economy seat, think about the fact that Kanye West hits the skies in a private, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two-decker Boeing 747</a>. If this huge jet resembles Air Force One, that's because the president's iconic air-transport is the same make.</p><p>Kim Kardashian took her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">followers</a> on a Snapchat tour of her husband's luxurious plane, including a bedroom suite, a "chill space," (aka living room), and a few spacious marble bathrooms. This Boeing 747 can fit 660 (!) if used for conventional air travel, so suffice to say the whole Yeezy crew has space to roam. Experts estimate that a plane of this caliber costs $200,000 per hour to operate.</p><h2 id=g-wagon-240-000>G-Wagon: $240,000</h2><p>Kanye West sure knows how to spoil his wife.
