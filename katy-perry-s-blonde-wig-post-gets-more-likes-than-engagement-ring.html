But Friday, April 19’s, blonde, shoulder-length look seems to have topped them all, bringing in more likes on Instagram than her engagement photo with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Orland Bloom</strong></a> featuring her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive pink diamond</a>.</p><p>In a mirror selfie with Kardashian-favorite hairstylist Chris Appleton, the “Firework” singer looked almost unrecognizable with soft blonde strands. Whether it was the undone style, the longer cut or the buttery hue, people really seemed to respond. At 2.5 million likes to date, this blonde wig pic garnered over 400,000 more likes than her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engagement</a> photo with Bloom, which earned 2.1 likes.</p><p>As you may remember, on February 15, the American Idol judge shared an up-close selfie with the Pirates of the Caribbean actor showing off her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage-looking ring</a>, a pink center gem surrounded by eight petal-like diamonds set in yellow gold. But the possibly five million dollar ring seems to have stood no chance against this new look.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Besides different shades of blonde the “Roar” singer has colored her hair red, pink, purple… the list goes on! Even though her current go-to seems to be lighter shades, a couple years ago she was all about a dark, almost-black, hue often accented with pink or blue streaks.</p><p>The one thing that’s always remained the same is her fearlessness when it comes to going big with her look. She bleached her brows for the 2016 Met Gala and on the February 2019 cover of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper magazine</a>. Just last night, April 21, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">channeled her inner villain</a> dressing up as Ursula from The Little Mermaid for American Idol’s Disney-themed night.</p><p>The whole thing got Us thinking: Is this warm hue on the natural blonde her best look ever? We decided to see with a poll! Purple, auburn, black or blonde, which Katy Perry hair color is your favorite?
