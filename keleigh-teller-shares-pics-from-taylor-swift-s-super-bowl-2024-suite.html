CONGRATS 🎉🎉,” <span>Teller, 31, wrote alongside footage from <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>‘s suite, including <a href=#>new video angles</a> of Teller and <strong>Lana Del Rey </strong>getting knocked over as the group celebrated the Kansas City Chiefs <a href=#>overtime win</a> against the San Francisco 49ers at&nbsp;Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Keleigh, the wife of actor <strong>Miles Teller</strong>, added: “Best day with my Chiefs fam. One for the books 🏈💥 #SuperBowl #poppipartner #drinkpoppi.”</p><p><span>This isn’t the first time Keleigh has been by Swift’s side this NFL season. The twosome <a href=#>made a trip</a> to Baltimore, Maryland, last month to watch the Swift’s boyfriend<strong>, Travis Kelce</strong>, and the Chiefs defeat the Ravens for the AFC championship. During the game, Keleigh gave fans a glimpse into the post-game celebration that included <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong>, Travis’ brother,<strong> Jason Kelce</strong>, and his wife, <strong>Kylie Kelce.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I said remember this moment 🥹🥹,” Keleigh captioned a January 28 TikTok video, which was set to “Long Live (Taylor’s Version).” The clip featured Keleigh, Swift and more of Travis’ closest friends and family raising a glass in honor of the Chiefs’ win.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Kylie and i bleed green but were [sic] out 🦅. so chiefs nation ❤️💥,” she added. (The Tellers are loyal fans of the Philadelphia Eagles, where Jason, 36, has played as a center since 2011.)</span></p><p><span>Keleigh has been a fan of Swift for years, but her bond with the “Anti-Hero” singer deepened after she and Miles starred in Swift’s 2021 “<a href=#>I Bet You Think About Me</a>’ music video — a “From the Vault” soundtrack off of Swift’s Red (Taylor’s Version) album.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“So grateful for @Miles_Teller for being the greatest dance partner and friend to me,” Swift wrote on X when promoting the track. “And @keleighteller, who is the coolest living human on planet earth. The bride was willing to risk it all 🥰🧣.”</span></p><p><span>Months later, Miles shared how the pop star made his wife cry — in a good way — when the trio were on set to film the music video, which was directed by Swift’s other pal <strong>Blake Lively</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span>“When we were shooting, Taylor played for Keleigh the ‘All Too Well (10 Minute Version)’&nbsp; for the first time,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News </a>in July 2022. “Keleigh was just looking at Taylor in her wedding dress and Taylor and I dancing while she was listening to ‘All Too Well,’ the new one, and she was just bawling her eyes out.”</span></p><p><span>Keleigh was later Swift’s date for the 2024 Golden Globe Awards where the duo made headlines for a gossip session with <strong>Selena Gomez</strong> that was caught on camera. Keleigh also raised her glass in solidarity with Swift during the ceremony when Golden Globes host <strong>Jo Koy</strong> made a joke about the singer’s presence at NFL games amid her romance with Travis.</span></p><p><span>Keep scrolling for Keleigh’s best BTS content from Super Bowl LVIII:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepJWetKl5056jpZ2iYsCprdGeqmaomZjAbrLRqKRmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kqHq0wc%2BeqWaan6y5bn6Pa2tmq6WewaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./johnny-crawford-biography-children-age-married-wife-gay.html><span>←</span><span>Johnny Crawford Biography, Children, Age, Married, Wife, Gay</span></a>
