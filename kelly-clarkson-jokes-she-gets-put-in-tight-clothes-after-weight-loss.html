I really can’t bend in these,” she quipped as she attempted to grab the mini bottle of vodka from the concertgoer, per a Tuesday, January 2, <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok video</a>. “Dude, this is tight. Like, I lost weight and they’re like, ‘Let’s get you into this tight s—t.’”</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Clarkson eventually found a way to reach down off the stage and proceeded to chug the liquor while the crowd cheered and one fan yelled, “Skinny legend!”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Clarkson’s lighthearted remarks come one day after she opened up about what led to <a href=#>her recent weight loss</a>, crediting her move from Los Angeles to the Big Apple for her changing physique.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Walking in the city is quite the workout,” the pop star explained during a Wednesday, January 3, interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a>, noting that she often explores the streets of Manhattan with her kids: daughter River, 9, and son Remington, 7, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong>.</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;“We go walk the dogs a few times at the park. We’ll go for ice cream because my daughter will wear me down,” she added. “We’ll go make slime and we’ll go to the museum.”</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Clarkson shared that she’s gotten “really into infrared saunas” as of late and “just got a cold plunge because everybody wore me down.” She’s also been “listening” to her doctors, noting that for “a couple years I didn’t.”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><a title=@sabbbb0 href=#>@sabbbb0</a><p>I TOOK A SHOT WITH FREAKING KELLY CLARKSON!!! <a title=kellyclarkson href=#>#kellyclarkson</a> <a title=chemistryresidency href=#>#chemistryresidency</a> <a title=lasvegas href=#>#lasvegas</a> I have so many videos from many angles and have no idea who sent me this one.

While talking with <strong>Serena Williams</strong> during a November 2020 episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>, the Grammy winner revealed that she feels a need to “stand strong” for herself when it comes to her physique. “I feel like I have to keep talking about it every once in a while and stand up. I try to do it in a comedic way and keep it light, but well, sometimes you just gotta shut [haters] down,” she said.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>More recently, Clarkson stood up to ex-husband Blackstock, 47, when he told her she wasn’t “sexy” enough to become a judge on The Voice. In court documents obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Post </a>on Tuesday, January 2, Clarkson alleged that her then-spouse, who was also her talent manager at the time, tried to persuade her to pass on the gig and claimed NBC was “looking for more of a sex symbol” to fill the role.</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Clarkson went on to judge the singing competition series for 8 seasons. Her divorce from Blackstock, meanwhile, was finalized in March 2022. “Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays,” she reportedly told her attorney, Ed McPherson, in the docs.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaknZyhxm6vy5qppKufo3qru8qeqmarmJp6qLHTrGSpraRitq9506KeoaxdmLmwwMeeqmaZlqmys3nWnqCgoKRiubC%2F0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juan-soto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Juan Soto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
