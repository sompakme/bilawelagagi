"While on probation they are at constant risk of being returned to prison or jail — not for committing a new crime but for technical violations like missing a meeting with their probation officer."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 50 women were reportedly selected based on a track record of rehabilitation and success during their time on parole. Kim added that she hopes her contribution can offer the mothers a “second chance they’ve earned.”</p><p>The reality star went on to share a video across her social media platforms featuring some of the women who received a payment.</p><p>"This is going to take a lot of stress off me financially, mentally, and I really appreciate you guys," one mother, Tarlexus, told the camera. Another, Drew, said, "This is actually not just making a difference. This is life changing. I don't even know where to begin to express my gratitude. I'm going to do so much with this newfound freedom."</p><p>It's unclear how much money Kim and Michael Rubin donated in total.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim has been vocal about her passion for advocacy work. Earlier this year, the mother-of-four revealed she’s open to <a href=#>leaving reality television to pursue a full-time career in law</a>. Kim is currently working towards her law degree.</p><p>"I would be just as happy being an attorney full time," she revealed while <a href=#>speaking at the TIME100 Summit</a> in April.</p><p>"The journey just really opened up my eyes so much," Kim went on "It gets overwhelming because there's so much to be done ... I brought my sister Khloé [Kardashian] to a prison for the first-time last week, and that was really eye-opening for her."</p><p>The reality star added that she hopes being a lawyer would be her life’s “most meaningful work.” "I hope so," she continued. "I always joke with my mom — who's my manager — I say Kim K. is retiring, and I'm just going to be an attorney."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Mindy Kaling Launches Limited-Time Collection With Andie Swimwear</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWanmrGjYrmms8ClZJ%2Bdlah6p7vRZmxpZaekuqa6jKilZqWfqbWmvtJmm5qxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-details-i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-scene.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Love Hewitt Details I Know What You Did Last Summer Scene</span></a>
