Just because their mother and I couldn’t make it as a perfect, romantic couple shouldn’t have anything to do with the kids. <a href=#>They don’t deserve our mistakes</a>, so we figured out a way.”</p><p>The Flip It Like Disick star added, “We still need to be as honest and as good to each other as if we were together. Let’s raise these children together and that’s it. We live a few miles apart and it’s simple.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnqmajmZnAbr7Um2ShnaJis6ax02ajqK6VYq5us86om2alkajAorPEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-james-net-worth-from-king-of-queens-to-king-of-memes.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin James' Net Worth: From King Of Queens To King Of Memes</span></a>
