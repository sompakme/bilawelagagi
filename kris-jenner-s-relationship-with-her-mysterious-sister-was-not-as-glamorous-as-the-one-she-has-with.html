That's right, she was an older sister to Karen Houghton - part-time nurse and author of Naturally Gourmet Cookbook and its follow-up volume.</p><p>We didn't often catch a glimpse of Karen on The Kardashians, but the two had a pretty rocky relationship over the years. In fact, Karen had even accused her sister of snubbing her in the past. That said, Kris has also clapped back in her own way, from time to time.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karen Houghton sadly passed away on March 19th, 2024</a>, and although Kris Jenner paid her a sweet tribute, fans would like to know other facts about their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/this-is-how-kris-jenner-spends-her-mammoth-net-worth-1b.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>This Is How Kris Jenner Spends Her Mammoth Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kris Jenner has done well for herself over the years by being a "momager" given that she is creeping toward a $200 million net worth.</span><p><strong>Updated March 2024: </strong>Despite speaking out against her sister on countless occasions, it seems Karen Houghton's feud with Kris Jenner was fairly one-sided. In December 2019, they were pictured together at a pre-Christmas gathering. Sadly, Karen Houghton passed away on March 19, 2024, at the age of 65. Not much had been mentioned about Kris' feud with her sister in the past few years, but Jenner paid her a sweet tribute on social media, remembering their relationship.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner-39-s-sister-karen-houghton-called-her-out-when-she-39-d-upset-her>Kris Jenner's Sister Karen Houghton Called Her Out When She'd Upset Her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kris-jenner.jpg><p>Karen Houghton had quite the history of being outspoken towards Kris Jenner when she felt provoked. Exhibit A: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in one interview, she accused her sibling of being obsessed with money</a>, and accumulating more of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"You know what drives Kris? Power, power, power and money. It’s called wanting power, Gucci purses, Bentleys," she told Radar Online.</strong></p><p>That isn't all she's had to say about her sister, though. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karen has also accused Kris of neglecting their mother</a>, MJ. Speaking to Daily Mail at one point, she claimed, "I called up Kris yelling at her, because I was like, "You need to help your mom more and you know it."</p><p>She's also claimed that Kris had cut her out of her life, and ignored her. "I get p***ed off at her because she doesn’t respond to me. If you think your sister would call you back, she doesn’t. And it hurts me," she said.</p><p>As for Kris, she's opted not to get into a public mudslinging match. That's not to say that the comments she made didn't hurt, though. Speaking to RadarOnline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she admitted to falling out of touch</a>, but hinted that it was down to Karen's behavior. <strong>"Unfortunately, my sister has been dealing with demons for years ... I am not in touch with her. But I wish her the very best,"</strong> she quipped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=karen-houghton-weighed-in-on-kris-39-marriage>Karen Houghton Weighed In On Kris' Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kris-and-caitlyn-jenner.jpg><p>In 2014, Karen Houghton gave another interview to RadarOnline. This time, it was about Kris and her estranged husband.</p><p>Karen mused that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there would be no reunion between the former couple</a>, despite their seemingly friendly behavior. Her take? Caitlyn Jenner had left her sister because Kris' yelling had become intolerable. She also revealed that Kris was struggling with the split and was not dating anyone.</p><p>Although Karen claimed to know everything about Kris' life and how she was dealing with the separation, few could forget the famed momager's comments on not being in one another's lives. Nor, for that matter, could they forget another comment that had been made about their dynamic, from an unnamed source.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The reality is that Karen and Kris have not had a discussion about Kris' private life for 28 years," the insider claimed.</p><p>Informed or not, Houghton's actions caused a rift between the already distant sisters. The source informed Radar that Jenner was disappointed that her sister chose to share private information with the media and sold her out, especially considering that the TV personality had always been there to help Houghton financially.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_the-kardashian-jenner-family-net-worths-ranked-from-richest-to-poorest_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Kardashian-Jenner Family Net Worths Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Kardashian-Jenner family has established a huge empire in the last decade.

A source stated that Houghton was not as image-conscious or focused on certain standards as Kris Jenner, and didn't tend to think about the ramifications of who she associated herself with.</p><p>So, what's so bad about the men she'd been associated with? One such former partner was the father of her daughter, Mark Zettel. Seven years after divorcing, Karen was forced to take out a protection order to keep him away from them. Another was Steven Edward Thornton - a man with over 12 arrests for burglary and theft to his name.</p><p>The Kardashians might not shy away from drama (we're looking at you, <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong>), but brushes with the law are a no-go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=karen-houghton-reportedly-got-a-facelift-to-look-like-her-sister-kris-jenner>Karen Houghton Reportedly Got A Facelift To Look Like Her Sister, Kris Jenner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/karen-houghton-1.jpg><p>Despite all the tension, it's safe to say Karen Houghton wasn't completely anti-her older sibling. In fact, when it came to Kris' looks, she was a major fan. So much so, in fact, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2016, she went under the knife to look more like her</a>.
