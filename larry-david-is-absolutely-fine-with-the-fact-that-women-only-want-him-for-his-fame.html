If he has an opinion about something, he's going to share it, no matter what someone else thinks. He has such a massive fanbase thanks to his candid nature and refusal to sugarcoat anything. People always want to hear what Larry thinks since he has so much to say about the world. Even if he's talking about something as small as how annoying it can be to confirm lunch plans over email, he has a singular point of view that no one else can match.</p><p>Over a decade ago, Larry David was interviewed on <strong><a href=#>Conan O'Brien</a></strong>'s show CONAN and he was just as truthful as fans would expect him to be. When the comedians chatted about Larry's romantic life, Larry made a hilarious and memorable comment...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-larry-david-say-about-his-dating-life-on-conan>What Did Larry David Say About His Dating Life On CONAN?</h2><p>Larry David can't help but be a little awkward while saying something totally hilarious. Anytime he is interviewed, whether in print or on TV, he shows fans that he can poke fun at himself and that he doesn't take anything too seriously.</p><p>It's no surprise that when he appeared on CONAN 11 years ago, the conversation took a humorous turn and he and Conan O'Brien discussed his personal life. When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry talked about his dating life</a>, he admitted that it's alright if people only want to date him thanks to how famous he is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar48658328-1.jpg><p>Conan said, "Your life has changed a lot. You are single now and I was wondering, you're out there, you're dating. Do you ever worry that women will be more attracted to your fame than who you are really are a person? Do you know what I'm saying? Is that a concern of yours?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/seinfeld-s-executive-producer-revealed-the-show-turned-into-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-when-larry-david-left.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Seinfeld's Executive Producer Revealed The Show Turned Into A Nightmare Behind The Scenes When Larry David Left">Seinfeld's Executive Producer Revealed The Show Turned Into A Nightmare Behind The Scenes When Larry David Left</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Larry David left Seinfeld after its seventh season and it caused chaos behind the scenes.</p><p>Larry asked, "What are you nuts? Why would that concern me, why would I care? Are they supposed to like me for me? Is that the idea? They had many, many years to like me for me... There was no liking for me and there shouldn't have been. There's not that much to like, actually."</p><p>Larry kept laughing as he answered the question and said, "Come and be with me, yeah. That's good. That's a good thing" before continuing, "If a woman now said to me 'I just want to be with you for who you are,' I'd say 'Get out of here... You've got the wrong guy. Go find a nice dentist."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49659466-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if he dated a lot before becoming famous, Larry David answered, "My problem is that I was very particular, which is odd because I was very desperate at the time. It's an odd kind of combination to be desperate and then particular."</p><p>He joked that Quasimodo from The Hunchback Of Notre Dame is both of these things as well.</p><p>While Larry David and Conan O'Brien's conversation was a light-hearted one that was full of laughter, O'Brien made a fair point that as someone gets richer and more well-known, dating can become much more challenging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Curb-Your-Enthusiasm-Larry-David-Featured-Image.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Larry seems to take his fame and wealth in stride. Of course, things look very different for him now that he has money from Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm and can work on the kind of projects that he really wants to work on. He still seems humble, though, and he has never lost his signature sense of humor or his witty personality. The fact that he can joke about why people would want to date him proves that he's one of the more interesting and likable celebrities.</p><h2 id=who-is-larry-david-39-s-ex-wife>Who Is Larry David's Ex-Wife?</h2><p>Larry David has been married twice. He was married to Laurie David from 1993 until 2007. The couple share two daughters: 27-year-old Romy David and 29-year-old Cazzie David. Cazzie is known for writing the book "No One Asked For This" and for her former serious relationship with Pete Davidson.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Larry-David.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Is Larry David's Ex-Wife Really Doing Now?">What Is Larry David's Ex-Wife Really Doing Now?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Since she got divorced from Larry David, Laurie David has stayed active as an author, filmmaker, and activist.</p><p>According to People, the two had a good divorce and stayed on friendly terms because of their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/larry-david-laurie-david.jpg><p>Laurie is a writer, producer, and activist who is passionate about the environment. As Larry David explained in an interview with People in 2005, "She gets up now at 5 o’clock in the morning. I will wake up and I’ll see her at the computer, which she’s already been at for two hours."</p><p>Larry continued, "I hardly ever see her except when she’s telling me she’s giving my car away or I have to appear somewhere on behalf of [the environmentally friendly hybrid car] Prius... There is nothing selfish about her motives in any way. This is just in her blood to do something about global warming, and I’ll be d*mned if she’s not going to.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-larry-david-married-to-now>Who Is Larry David Married To Now?</h2><p>In 2020, Larry David and Ashley Underwood got married, and they are still together today. <a href=#>Larry is 38 years older than his wife</a>.

Huge problem! You at least have to ask. Ashley does not ask. She starts and then it’s impossible to catch up. And I’ll catch her.
