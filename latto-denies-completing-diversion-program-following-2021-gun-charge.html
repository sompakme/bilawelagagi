According to the outlet, completion of the diversion program required Latto to “complete a gun safety course, perform 120 hours of community service, and avoid all firearms.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, later on that evening, <a href=#>the Georgia native</a> hopped on Twitter to deny the report. Deeming the news “false,” she attributed the misinformation to the buzz surrounding her recent guest appearance on the song “Boom, Pt. 2″ by rapper Mello Buckzz. “[I don’t know] who put out that false-a** information, ’cause I’m not in no damn program,” she wrote. “Also, the situation happened over a year ago and y’all never even knew until I mentioned it in the ‘Boom, Pt. 2’ verse. Nun to ‘brag’ about. Leave me alone.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idk who put out that false ass information cause I’m not in no damn program…also the situation happened over a year ago & y’all never even knew until I mentioned it in the Boom pt 2 verse.

(@Latto) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 23, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Released on March 17, Latto’s verse and appearance in the “Boom, Pt. 2” music video resulted in her becoming a trending topic on social media, with a multitude of fans reacting to the lyrics. “I got locked up in the airport, goddamn, forgot the gun/In the head, I keep me one/What she said? I get her popped/Caught her down bad on the block/Then her a** got Milly Rocked/This a Glock, not a prop/What’s an opp? Bi**h, stop,” she raps on the track, which has since racked up over one million views on YouTube, alone.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In May 2021, Latto was arrested after being found in possession of a loaded gun while at LAX Airport in Los Angeles. According to reports, she was charged with carrying a loaded firearm and carrying a concealed weapon. While the status of the rap star’s legal troubles remain uncertain, she appears to have moved forward, as she continues her ascent up the music industry food chain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1462032164.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 777 rapper will make <a href=#>her latest awards show appearance</a> with a performance at the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards, which are set to take place on Monday (March 27).
