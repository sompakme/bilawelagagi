According to Michelle L. Rice, the legal representative of the Cohen estate, the family&nbsp;is “dismayed” that the RNC would knowingly use the song after their request was denied. She also lamented that the RNC would try to politicize the song so shamelessly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok Threatens To Sue Trump Administration Over App Ban</a></span></p><p>Cohen, a Canadian singer, songwriter, poet, and novelist who died in 2016, was raised in a traditional Jewish family but also studied Buddhism. He even lived at a Buddhist monastery for five years and became a fully ordained monk in 1996. The Montreal-born musician was famously apolitical, but he did oppose the Vietnam War. He also raised money to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rice added that if the RNC had requested the song, “You Want it Darker,” which includes the lyrics “They were middle class and tame/I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim,” they might have approved it. Meanwhile, Brian J. Monaco, president global chief marketing officer at Sony and ATV Music Publishing, also stated that permission for a live performance of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” was denied.</p><p>The Republican party has often been criticized for unauthorized music use. Last June, <a href=#>the Trump campaign</a> was blasted by Tom Petty's family for using the song "I Won't Back Down" at a campaign rally, without being authorized to do so. That same month, <a href=#>the Rolling Stones</a> threatened to sue Trump over the use of their songs, such as "You Can't Always Get What You Want," at campaign rallies. In the past, REM has also condemned Trump for using their song "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" at a rally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>"Back To The Future" Writer Says Biff Tannen Was Inspired By Donald Trump</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiklaS7or7DZpqooJWjeqa%2F05qrnmWcpLystc2gZKKmpKR6rbHGmqNmmZOptrC6jKitnqpdqsCmec6fZKGZnKGyrcHJmp9mmaRiv6%2Bvjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-renee-rapp-gay-age-height-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Is Renee Rapp Gay?
