Well, the star relies on an unexpectedly shocking treatment. “Shove your face in a bucket of ice or a sink full of ice water and it just sort of tightens everything,” James says. Once that’s sorted, she “obviously just slathers on the Magic Cream,” the Charlotte Tilbury product <a href=#>that launched her relationship as brand face</a>.</p><p>The Pam and Tommy star also reveals that her Hollywood beauty icon is <strong>Brigitte Bardot</strong>, but at a very specific time. She loves the iconic French actress’ look “in the ‘50s and ‘60s, when she would always have this amazing eyeliner and this incredible blonde hair.”</p><p>As for her celebrity crush, the British beauty also taps into a past era. “My forever Hollywood crush is <strong>Montgomery Cliff</strong>, [he’s] just so unbelievably dark and brooding and handsome… and an amazing actor,” she gushes. “And recently for a role, I was watching all these movies from the 1950s with <strong>Ava Gardner</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Liz Taylor</strong></a> and <strong>Richard Burton</strong> and I just got so swept away!”</p><p>To hear more of the star’s deep thoughts — including a rapid-fire Would You Rather — watch the video below!</p><p>James’ smooth talk in the film is quite apropos, as the newly-launched <a href=#>Hollywood Glow Glide Face Architect Highlighter</a> gives the complexion a seriously silky sheen. Available in seven shades from a luminous ivory (Pearl Glow) to pearly pink (Pillow Talk Glow) and sumptuous sun-kissed bronze (Bronze Glow, sold exclusively at <a href=#>charlottetilbury.com</a>), hues can be used as highlighter to add dimension to high points or as contour to sculpt angles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lily-James-Charlotte-Tilbury-campaign-2.jpg><p>The product was inspired by the lighting tricks of Old Hollywood. A high-tech formula boasts gel-wrapped pigments that diffuse light to blur imperfections, leaving a your-skin-only-better soft-focus, seemingly filtered finish.</p><p>Of course, this is not the first genius brainchild of <strong>Charlotte Tilbury</strong>, the makeup maven behind Hollywood’s A-list including <a href=#><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Penelope Cruz</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Kate Moss</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amal Clooney</strong></a> and more. Famous for her Magic Cream that acts as a moisturizer and primer for makeup as well as the Pillow Talk range of products that recreate the look of love, <a href=#>Hollywood Glow Glide Face Architect Highlighter</a> joins the roster of sure-to-become celebrity cult favorites. $48 each, <a href=#>charlottetilbury.com</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6G2rcWMo5imnaNivK95wZ6YrqypYsCmr9Geq6xlk5q5pq6MnKmuq5hitq95wqGYq6SfqcGmedOio5utoq56orCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-przybyl-bio-age-wiki-height-pregnant-salary-husband-wedding-net-worth-and-fox4-news.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Przybyl Bio, Age, Wiki, Height, Pregnant, Salary, Husband, Wedding, Net Worth and FOX4 News</span></a>
