December 10 marked the anniversary of ROH Final Battle 2022, where Jay competed in his second-to-last match before he lost his life in a car accident.</p><p>Maria Kanellis, a longtime friend of The Briscoes, also commented on the post on Twitter and said it was “so disrespectful and tone deaf,” as Mark and Jay were the only “Dem Boyz.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So disrespectful and tone deaf. These are the only Dem Boyz.<br>I said what I said and shouldn’t have deleted it. The magic is in the friendships, the memories, and the people you help. The Briscoes have helped and elevated everyone around them. This was from two years ago.
