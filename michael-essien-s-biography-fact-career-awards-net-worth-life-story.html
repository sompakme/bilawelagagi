He plays for the Panathinaikos and the Ghanaian national team. Essien began his career playing for Liberty Professionals in his home country. In 2000, he moved to France joining SC Bastia. Essien spent three seasons at the club appearing in over 60 matches before joining league champions Olympique Lyonnais in 2003. During his five-year stint in France, he acquired a French citizenship. In 2005, Essien signed with the Chelsea for a fee of £24.4 million, and at the time of his signing, he was the most expensive African footballer in history. He has won the Chelsea Goal of the season award twice, in the 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons. Because of regular injuries, Essien has rarely been seen in a Chelsea shirt these past two seasons. He is one of the legions of well-paid Chelsea players, the Ghanaian international signed a five-year contract in 2010 that is worth £80,000 a week. Given the injuries and suspensions facing his side, Essien might yet end a difficult season on a high with a crucial role in the Champions League final.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZmLWisctmnKyrmZq7tHnBoqagqpGltbp5xZqarWWTlr%2BmsdFmmLCZopnAbrrErWSwp6KptW64yJ%2BcZqukpL%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marvin-cortes-girlfriend-partner-are-marvin-and-renee-from-antm-still-together.html><span>←</span><span>Marvin Cortes Girlfriend, Partner: Are Marvin And Renee From ANTM Still Together?</span></a>
