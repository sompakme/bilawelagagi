The rug has been completely pulled from underneath me and now I must figure out how to move forward,” she noted in a statement to Us. “With such small children, I ask for privacy and kindness.”</p><p>The Grammy winner, who <a href=#>officially filed for divorce</a> on August 12, went on to accuse the Black Keys member of cheating in a since-deleted social media post.

Branch <a href=#>announced via social media in December 2020</a> that she had suffered a miscarriage. Less than one year later, the Arizona native revealed she was <a href=#>pregnant with her third child</a>. (Branch shares daughter Owen, 17, with ex-husband <strong>Teddy Landau</strong>.)</p><p>“You know you’re pregnant when…” she captioned her Instagram reveal in August 2021, sharing a photo of homemade pastries. “Woke up to a picture my friend Sonya sent [sic] of scones she was eating in England and I immediately had to hop out of bed and make a batch myself. … Couldn’t be more excited (and nervous! Hello, pregnancy after miscarriage anyone?!) to announce baby Carney is coming early 2022!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Daughter Willa Jaquet</a> arrived in February. Two months before announcing her divorce, Branch gushed over Carney in a sweet Father’s Day tribute. “This guy makes our world go around and we love him so ❤️,” she captioned a family photo in June. “I’m sorry you didn’t get to golf yesterday, Patrick! #FathersDay 🏆.”</p><p>The Ohio native was previously married to <strong>Denise Grollmus</strong> from 2007 to 2009 and to <strong>Emily Ward</strong> from 2012 to 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZOdsq24xGaZq5memLW0ecOopJ6rpJ6wbq3SrJiupKRisKK%2FxGaboqudnsC0scNmmKahlGKxqsLOq5qeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-mckean-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Michael McKean Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
