She first burst onto the scene as the star of the hit Disney Channel series Hanna Montana alongside her famous dad, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. From there, Cyrus' <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> career took off with hit singles like Party in the USA, Wrecking Ball, and Flowers, to name a few. Although she's often accused of gaining fame because of her famous last name and industry connections, few deny that she is a talented and gifted performer.</p><p>Miley Cyrus' transition from a child star to an adult has, the singer has admitted, been difficult as her image has drastically changed throughout her career. So, too, has her personal life as the singer was once famously married to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, which resulted in one of Hollywood's messiest break-ups. Not long after, Cyrus experienced the dissolution of her parents' marriage, which caused a rift within the Cyrus household...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-miley-cyrus-39-s-relationship-like-with-her-father-billy-ray-cyrus>What's Miley Cyrus's Relationship Like With Her Father Billy Ray Cyrus?</h2><p>As the daughter of a celebrity, Miley Cyrus' life growing up in Nashville, Tennessee, was anything but ordinary. Before age 11, she had already had a cameo in her dad's TV series Doc and had acted in a major motion picture titled Big Fish, which Tim Burton directed.</p><p>In her memoir Miles to Go, Cyrus frequently recounted how a group of mean girls in school would bully her daily. One instance struck Cyrus the hardest:</p><p>"They started cussing me and telling me to get up. I sat there, frozen. I didn't know what to do. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't chicken. What could they do to me? People surrounded me. I stood up, still a foot shorter than they were, and said, 'What's your problem? What did I ever do to you?" Cyrus added that her classmates answered: "Your dad's a one-hit wonder. You'll never amount to anything -- just like him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miley-cyrus-doing-an-appearance-as-hannah-montana-in-2007.jpg><p>Instances with bullies weren't the only way Miley Cyrus was affected by her father's celebrity. Cyrus also once spoke about how her father was often on the road touring across America to the point where neither she nor the rest of their family saw him very much.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus Hints That She’ll Never Tour Again As She Admits It’s Bad For Her Mental Health</a></span></p><p>Miley Cyrus may have longed for her father when he was away, but things would later change when they were both cast to play father and daughter in Hannah Montana. The series, which ran for four seasons, told the story of a young girl living a secret life as a pop star while living a humble life with her brother and famous father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>CNN reported on an account Miley Cyrus gave about the audition process for Hannah Montana:</p><p>"After I had been cast, it was time for them to bring the dads in to audition. And the casting agent said 'your dad is so cute, it would be amazing if he could actually play your dad on the show, but we don't know if that's actually possible. My mom said we had been apart as a family because of the show he was doing in Toronto, and that she would try to make it work and get him to California to audition. And we did."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miley-cyrus-and-her-dad-billy-ray-cyrus-attending-a-hannah-montana-movie-premiere.jpg><p>Although the show revived Billy Ray Cyrus' career and catapulted Miley Cyrus into fame, her father would later state that he regretted the decision for them both to have starred in the show:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The [expletive] show <a href=#>destroyed my family</a>. I'd take it back in a second. For my family to be here and just everybody be okay, safe and sound and happy and normal would have been fantastic. Heck, yeah. I'd erase it all in a second if I could." Billy Ray Cyrus seemingly referred to his daughter's substance abuse issues, which she later successfully sought treatment for.</p><h2 id=why-did-miley-cyrus-39-parents-trisha-and-billy-ray-cyrus-divorce>Why Did Miley Cyrus' Parents Trisha And Billy Ray Cyrus Divorce?</h2><p>After decades of marriage, Miley Cyrus' parents announced that they were getting a divorce. ET News quoted the pair's joint statement to the press: "...we have decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">go our separate ways</a> - not with sadness, but with love in our hearts...it is now time to create our own paths. We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents. We have not come to this decision lightly or quickly, but with so much going on in the world, we wanted to provide some clarity and closure so we can remain focused on what is important."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Miley-Cyruss-Mum-And-Dad-Are-Getting-Divorced.jpg><p>However, the vague statement only added to public curiosity. Soon, it emerged that the seemingly happy couple had called it quits because of irreconcilable differences. The divorce court documents also revealed that Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus had been estranged and living apart for some time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus 'Was Upset' And Broke Down Into Tears During Her Emotional Interview On The Ellen Show</a></span></p><p>Interestingly enough, Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus divorced each other many times before ultimately calling it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Cosmopolitan, Tish Cyrus once alluded to her struggles in maintaining relationships: "I <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">think that any relationship</a>—whether it's marriage or family, it doesn't matter—it's you truly do have to take care of it and nurture and really work hard at relationships. And that's not always easy, especially in the business that we're in. So I think it's a lot just dedication and communication, which I'm not very good at."</p><h2 id=how-has-miley-cyrus-39-parents-39-divorce-affected-their-family>How Has Miley Cyrus' Parents' Divorce Affected Their Family?</h2><p>As fans of Miley Cyrus know, the star is one of six siblings. Her family tree is quite interesting. Before marrying Billy Ray Cyrus, Tish Cyrus had two children, Brandi and Trace, both of whom Billy Ray Cyrus adopted. Billy Ray Cyrus also had a son, Christopher Cody, with his girlfriend before marrying Miley Cyrus' mother. Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus also have three kids: Miley, Braison, and Noah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Miley-Cyrus-siblings.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noah Cyrus, Miley Cyrus' younger sister and a successful singer in her own right, once spoke about the difficulties of growing up in a famous family: "...being born in the family I was in, everyone gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley's little sister. But you know, I always felt like I was that person that no one gave a [expletive] about due to what people said to me online. It was absolutely unbearable. And that's why I write, 'My sister's like sunshine, bringing good light wherever she'll go/and I was born to rain clouds, blessed in her shadows.' Because, that's what everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow."</p><p>By all accounts, the Cyrus family experienced their share of family drama over the years, but none more so than when Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus split up for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A divide between the siblings occurred when their parents began dating other people. Before the ink was dry on the divorce papers, Billy Ray Cyrus was engaged to his much younger girlfriend, Australian-born singer and songwriter Johanna Rosie Hodge, aka Firerose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/miley-cyrus-and-her-siblings-feuded-viciously-after-dad-billy-ray-s-remarriage-here-s-the-real-reason-why-all-3-please.jpg><p>Tish Cyrus moved on fairly quickly from her divorce when she dated and married actor Dominic Purcell.</p><p>The divorcee's seemed very happy in their respective relationships. But how did it affect their children?</p><p>According to industry reports, while Miley, Trace, and Brandi Cyrus were there for their mother's lavish wedding to Dominic Purcell in Malibu, their other siblings, Noah and Braison, were noticeably absent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tish-cyrus-and-dominic-purcell.jpg><p>Miley Cyrus even helped plan and escort her mother down the aisle at her wedding, stating to Vogue: "To stand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beside my mother</a> and give her away to Dom is a moment I will cherish for the rest of my life. It was like I was in a fairytale. The most romantic fairytale you could ever imagine."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Billy Ray Cyrus Feel About HIs Ex-Wife Tish’s Engagement News?</a></span></p><p>Adding fuel to speculations that Noah and Braison Cyrus were against their mother and were supporting their father was that on the day of their mother's wedding, they posted photos on Instagram of them out shopping not far from the wedding location.

And I can see my wheels turning and watching his voice and the way that he's using the instrument. I will say that I feel, vocally, my dad was underappreciated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/miley-cyrus-tish-cyrus.jpg><p>Also, according to The Daily Mail, Miley Cyrus told a member of her inner circle that she hadn't spoken to her father since his split from her mother, adding: "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley is all about peace</a>, but she didn't agree with some things that her father has done.
