I love this product so much. … I use it every day,” Kaling told <a href=#>Allure</a> in a Tuesday, July 18, interview.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kaling shared that she’s “struggled” with <a href=#>hyperpigmentation</a> for years and was on the hunt for products that “help with acne scars and dark spots.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I feel incredibly lucky that I’m someone who’s celebrated for my dark brown skin, and I did not want to change that,” Kaling told the publication. “So, this is something that just really works for me. So that’s why I came on as an investor, not just as an ambassador or whatever.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mindy-Kaling-on-Celebrating-Darker-Skin-406.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to hyperpigmentation, Kaling has also struggled with <a href=#>melasma</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“If you have melanated skin, you have to be so careful about lasers,” she told Allure. “But a lot of times people who have melasma after pregnancy can do a simple laser and be fine with it. I can’t do that because I keloid, which is another thing that happens to people who have darker skin.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Aside from Lion Pose, Kaling is a big fan of Drunk Elephant, Senté and Augustinus Bader.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Kaling’s latest business venture comes after she unveiled a <a href=#>new collection with Andie Swim</a> in May.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3><span class=s2>“I bet you didn’t know my side hustle was swimsuit design,” Kaling announced via Instagram at the time alongside a photo that captured her in a sunny yellow one-piece. “I am so excited to launch my first-ever swimwear collection in collaboration with Andie! I designed new limited-edition styles, and also re-imagined classic Andie suits in bold + fun Mindy-approved colors (but also some classic colors if you’re, like, trying to be chill).”</span><span class=s3><br></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>On the website, Kaling can be seen modeling the drop, which is available in sizes XS to XXXXL, showing off her fit figure in a sexy black one-piece as well as a textured bikini and a light blue mini dress.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6K2r7DYZqKapJmjtG7AwKWirGWdmrmiv8yaZJqmlGKwprjEm6marJmjtG60xKtknZmioHq0t8inZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./da-brat-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Da Brat News - Us Weekly</span></a>
