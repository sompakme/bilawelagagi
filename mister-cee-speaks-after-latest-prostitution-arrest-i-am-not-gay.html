Now, Cee is back in the hot seat after yet another arrest for the same offense this Thursday (May 2). The 46-year-old deejay, whose real name is Calvin LeBrun, was allegedly approached in Brooklyn by an undercover male police officer posing as a prostitute. Throughout the interview, Cee maintains that he was approached by an undercover female officer.</p><p>This morning, Mister Cee joined the Hot 97 morning show with Peter Rosenberg, Cipha Sounds, K-Foxx and Ebro Darden to address the recent arrest. Disputing allegations that he is gay, Cee called the arrest “dumb luck” and a “sting operation,” stating that the arresting officer was female and that reports had suddenly changed.</p><p>“I am not gay,” he told Darden. “I have an addiction to not only prostitution. I have an addiction to getting the quickie. People have accused me of being gay for probably ten years now. I don’t care what people think.”</p><p>In the sometimes heated exchange, the show’s hosts grilled Mister Cee on both arrests and his sexuality. Accusing Darden and company of failing to do their research, Cee attempted to highlight inconsistencies in both stories as a defense for his claims. The hosts simultaneously offered comedic banter as well as encouraged the deejay to be honest.</p><p>“Let’s say if I’m lying, that’s my choice,” Cee said. “If I’m lying and I chose not to come out, that’s my choice.”</p><p>Mister Cee also chronicled his addiction to paid sexual acts to the show’s hosts. The deejay said that his last relationship led him into a realm of “hit it and quit it” activity via underground strip clubs and prostitution rings. He said that he has undergone counseling his first arrest and that he would be stepping away from radio to mend the issue.</p><p>“I’ma suspend myself, I’ma take myself off the radio,” he said. “I’ma take some time off and I’ma suspend myself.”</p><p>Check out the full interview here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K2tMDEq2ScnZViwLGxwKSqZpmWqbKzecuaq56rpGK9s7vSraCtraSevK95wKupnqukYrZurcxmpaisXZyuunmQbmprbGVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julia-louis-dreyfus-brings-son-charlie-hall-to-state-dinner-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Julia Louis-Dreyfus Brings Son Charlie Hall to State Dinner: Pics</span></a>
