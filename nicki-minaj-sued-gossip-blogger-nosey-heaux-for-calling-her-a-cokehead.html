Couple artists in the folder too. I’ll own your publishing. Duds”</p><p>Nicki Minaj is making one thing very clear: She won't put up with wild statements about her on social media, and now she's filed a lawsuit.</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the "Super Freaky Girl" rapper and her legal team have filed a defamation lawsuit against a woman named Marley Green, who runs a popular celebrity gossip blog called "Nosey Heaux." The complaint is related to a video uploaded on Monday, September 12, in which Green allegedly says Minaj is "shoving all this cocaine, shoving in all this cocaine up her nose.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Allegedly. Thank you. Allegedly. But we all know it's true," she continues. "Fuck, listen. I can't even say allegedly with that because I, we all know it's true. I'm not saying allegedly on that. Nicki Minaj is a cokehead." However, Minaj claims in the suit that she has never used cocaine.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Mattel Launches Lawsuit Over Nicki-Minaj Themed Chips</b></a></span></p><p>Additionally, the filing also alleges that Green — who she accuses of working on behalf of an unnamed rival of the star — made "vile" comments about her infant son. Per the outlet's report, the blogger allegedly said the 1-year-old should get therapy, because he would grow up "to be a rapist too," in an apparent reference to his father and Minaj's husband, Kenneth Petty, who was convicted in 1995 for attempted rape in the first-degree. She is seeking damages of no less than $75,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Minaj's attorney, Judd Burstein, dubbing Green a "nobody... whose main accomplishments in life have been a string of criminal charges, bail jumping and bad debts," he did note that the video-in-question received 2,000 likes and was retweeted over 250 times on Twitter. As such, Burstein told TMZ that "my marching orders are to aggressively sue anyone with a media or social media following who damages her with intentional lies," before adding that "eventually, the lesson will be learned."</p><p>"When this case is over, she will no longer be permitted to use the name 'Nosey Heaux' because we will take her trademark from her when she does not have enough money to pay the judgment," he continued. "Anyone else who spreads lies about Nicki will suffer a similar fate."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nosey Heaux also posted on her twitter account claiming that Nicki was harassing her on Instagram.</p><p>“Nicki Minaj is unhinged and harassing me on Instagram. She doxxed me and sent her barbz to threaten to kill me. She’s been commenting under my IG posts since like 24 hours ago. No one around her is smart enough to just take her phone. #Survivingthepettys RT”</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Cardi B Visits Her Former Middle School In Bronx And Give A $100,000 Donation</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PAPER</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS7qq%2FKomSmoZ6Wt26%2F1J6bZp%2BfqMCqvIybo6ifl5q%2FbrrOrJyyZZiarrbEjJ%2Bmq2WTlrmttc2gZKGdomKubq%2FOpJyhnZGZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-anderson-actress-bio-age-height-husband-emmerdale-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Anderson (Actress) Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Emmerdale and Net Worth.</span></a>
