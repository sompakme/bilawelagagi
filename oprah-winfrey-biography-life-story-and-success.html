As one of the wealthiest women in the world, Oprah has also acted and even owns her own television network. Although she is wealthy and successful now, her life didn't start out privileged as one might think.</p><h2 id=oprah-s-childhood><strong>Oprah's Childhood</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oprah was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi, although her name was meant to be Orpah originally. The misspelling on her birth certificate made her name Oprah, which became her name as we know it now. Vernita Lee, a housemaid who was not married, is Oprah's mother and her father is unknown. She and her mother lived with her grandmother Hattie Mae Lee in poverty for six years.</p><p>After this, her mother moved her to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she continued to work exhausting hours as a low-income maid. During the time they lived in Milwaukee, Oprah became a half-sister to Patricia, who later died in 2003 because of cocaine-related causes. Raising two daughters became difficult for her mother, so in 1962 she sent Oprah to go live with a man named Vernon, who she believed to be Oprah's biological father, in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>Soon after Oprah moved to Nashville, her mother had another daughter, but she had to give her up for adoption because she could not afford the cost. Oprah only found out about her second half-sister in 2010. When she moved back in with her mother, Oprah found out that she had a half-brother named Jeffrey, who her mother had given birth to without telling her. Jeffrey passed away in 1989 due to AIDS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starting at 9 years old, Oprah was molested by several members of her family, including her: uncle, cousin and family friend. She did not share this with her family until she turned 24, but they did not believe what she had to say. At the young age of 13 Oprah ran away from home due to the abuse she was experiencing. A year later, at age 14, she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, but he died shortly after.</p><p>Oprah then attended Lincoln High School, where she was successful with the Upward Bound Program. This led to acceptance at the Nicolet High School, which was a wealthy school in the suburbs. She was teased and ridiculed by classmates because of her poverty, which prompted her to steal from her mother. She used the money to go out with classmates and appear as though she wasn't as poor as she actually was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after this, her mother sent her back to Nashville to live with Vernon. Because Oprah's mother would not take her back, Vernon became the only parent in her life. He made sure she went to school and pushed her to become an honors student and part of the speech team at East Nashville High School. The accomplishments she received during high school led to her being given a paid scholarship for Tennessee State University. While studying communications she worked at a grocery store, won beauty pageants and eventually worked for a radio station.</p><h2 id=oprah-s-career><strong>Oprah's Career</strong></h2><p>After working for years at the radio station, Oprah eventually got into media and became the first black female news anchor at a local television station. Soon after that, she anchored the evening news and was invited to be a co-host on People Are Talking, which was a local talk show. After she decided to move to Chicago in 1983, Winfrey was offered to host a morning talk show named AM Chicago. She ended up turning this from a barely watched show to the most watched show on the network. Oprah's career exploded after this and she was soon offered The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired the first episode on September 6, 1986.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1989, while still filming her talk show, Oprah produced and starred in The Women of Brewster Place, which was a drama miniseries. Years after this, she co-founded the Oxygen television network and also purchased her own channel named OWN. Oprah's talk show was wildly successful and lasted until May 25, 2011, when her final episode aired. Oprah said she was ready to leave her show so she could focus on her network, as lack of ratings was not the cause of her quitting.</p><p>Although Oprah is mainly known for her talk show, she has also starred and made appearances in several films. In The Color Purple she played Sofia and in Beloved she played Sethe. She also owns Harpo Films, which has released many different movies and documentaries, including Their Eyes Were Watching God. Oprah has several best-selling books, a successful magazine, a popular website and a book club.</p><h2 id=oprah-s-income><strong>Oprah's Income</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oprah's annual salary is around $223 million dollars.

She also dated Lloyd Kramer, but cheated on him with a married man. She also dated Randolph Cook, who was a drug addict, and the film critic Roger Ebert. In 1985 she dated Reginald Chevalier, who was a filmmaker. She ended things with him when she met her current boyfriend, Stedman Graham. They have been together since 1986 and have been engaged since 1992.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-s-spending-preferences><strong>Oprah's Spending Preferences</strong></h2><p>Oprah spends her money like anyone else and isn't known for extremely extravagant spending, although she did buy her best friend a $7.1 million dollar penthouse.</p><h2 id=oprah-s-cars><strong>Oprah's Cars</strong></h2><p>Oprah generally does not drive herself and has a driver that takes her everywhere. Several years ago she auctioned off classic cars, including: 1954 Mercedes-Benz, 1997 Aston Martin DB7 and a 1988 Rolls-Royce Corniche II. The money went to The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa.</p><h2 id=oprah-s-kids><strong>Oprah's Kids</strong></h2><p>Oprah does not have any children.
