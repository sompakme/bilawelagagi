The Simple Life was so popular that it is the origin of the reason why people still care about Paris Hilton. For example, people want to know <a href=#>what kind of mom Paris Hilton is</a>, about <a href=#>her husband's "love child"</a>, and that <a href=#>she talked about giving a baby a spray tan</a>.</p><p>However, after The Simple Life ended, Hilton and her co-star Nicole Richie's relationship took surprising turns. That fact makes it amazing that Hilton and Richie reportedly are set to reunite on TV.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>how dramatic Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie's relationship was</strong> after The Simple Life. Then, the article will look at the reports about <strong>Richie and Hilton's plans to reunite</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-have-an-explosive-relationship-history>Paris Hilton And Nicole Richie Have An Explosive Relationship History</h2><p>Since Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie were kids, they have rubbed elbows with the rich and famous thanks to who their parents are. For that reason, there is no doubt that most people wouldn't have understood Richie and Hilton's childhoods, which would have bonded them.</p><p>With that in mind, it makes sense that <strong>Hilton and Richie have been friends since they were kids</strong>. That years-long friendship was on full display when Richie and Hilton starred in The Simple Life during the 2000s.</p><p>Sadly for Hilton, Richie, their fans, and the people in their lives, however, <strong>the former co-stars and friends had a huge falling out</strong>. In May 2024, The U.S. Sun updated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its timeline of Richie and Hilton's relationship</a>, which cites several sources. According to that timeline, <strong>Hilton and Richie's relationship began falling apart in 2005</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/simplelife.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the timeline, Hilton first admitted that she and Richie were no longer friends as part of a 2005 statement she released. However, Hilton wouldn't outline what caused their falling out.</p><p>“It’s no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends. Nicole knows what she did, and that’s all I’m ever going to say about it.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/paris-hilton-waving.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Paris Hilton's Fragrances Have Earned Her Company More Than $2 Billion, Here's The Truth About Her Almost Unknown Side-Hustle</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Paris Hilton is constantly underestimated by people who have no idea how successful she is in the business world.</span><p>How much older is Paris Hilton than Nicole Richie, according to Famous Birthdays?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Paris Hilton born?:</p></td><td><p>February 17, 1981</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When was Nicole Richie born?:</p></td><td><p>September 21, 1981</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Paris Hilton than Nicole Richie?:</p></td><td><p>7 months and 4 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Around the same time, Richie told Today's anchors that she and Hilton "just grew apart". Richie also stated the gossip around the friendship ending “just turned into a much bigger thing than it is".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-looking-annoyed.jpg><p>While Richie tried to downplay the drama, The U.S. Sun's timeline states that rumors point to her as the one who got the ball rolling. According to the rumors, Richie showed Hilton's infamous intimate tape during a party. When Hilton found out, she was furious and that led to their longstanding friendship ending if the rumors are right.</p><p>On the bright side, that drama eventually subsided and <strong>Richie and Hilton revealed that they'd made peace</strong>. During this era, neither woman pretended they were best friends, but they spoke affectionately about each other.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-cruise-s-relationship-with-his-kids-is-questioned-after-he-finally-is-seen-in-public-with-them.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tom Cruise's Relationship With His Kids Revealed After He Steps Out In Public With Them For The First Time In Years</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tom Cruise was spotted with his adopted children which left fans with questions about how close the movie star is with his kids.</span><p>According to the timeline, E! News quoted Richie describing the state of her relationship with Hilton in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Paris is somebody that's been in my life since day one. I haven't spoken to her in a while technically, but if you really want to get into it, my view of a friendship is somebody that you don't necessarily have to talk to every day, somebody that you can call when you need them and they're just going to be there."</p><p>The timeline also reveals that Hilton talked about how much Richie means to her during a 2019 Watch What Happens Live appearance. "I love Nicole. We were actually texting three days ago because it's our high school reunion, so she was reminding me of the date."</p><p>In 2021, Richie attended Hilton's marriage to Carter Reum where they were pictured reuniting. Then in 2024, it was revealed that Hilton and Richie were making big plans together.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-are-returning-for-a-new-streaming-show>Paris Hilton And Nicole Richie Are Returning For A New Streaming Show</h2><p>In May 2024, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie's social media followers were surprised by a collage. The collage, which featured <strong>photos of Richie and Hilton together when they were young</strong>, was uploaded to both stars' Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-behind-the-scenes-of-the-simple-life.jpg><p>When both former reality TV stars uploaded the collage to their account, their fans didn't know that it seemed to be a harbinger of things to come. After all, Hilton and Richie have been on good terms, so the duo celebrating their history doesn't seem that remarkable.</p><p>However, around the same time the collage appeared on Instagram, TMZ published a bombshell report. According to that article, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richie and Hilton were preparing to star in a new show together</a></strong> decades after The Simple Life ended.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-13.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicole Richie Was "Given" To Dad Lionel Richie At Age 3, But Her Biological Dad Is Still In The Picture</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicole Richie has made amends with her biological parents over the years, but that does not mean she has a close relationship with both.</span><p>According to TMZ, <strong>Hilton and Richie's planned new reality show had already been greenlit</strong> by the time the world learned about it.

Instead, they were only able to reveal that Hilton and Richie reportedly had been in talks about how to reunite for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-looking-close.jpg><p>Of course, it was surprising for fans to learn that Richie and Hilton would be reuniting on TV so many years after their original show ended. Even still, it could be argued that TMZ's report revealed something that was even more surprising.</p><p><strong>Who are Paris Hilton's friends, according to TMZ?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Marc Jacobs</strong></li><li><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></li><li><strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong></li><li><strong>Nicky Hilton</strong></li><li><strong>Gigi Gorgeous</strong></li><li><strong>Jaime King</strong></li><li><strong>Rachel Zoe</strong></li><li><strong>Cara Delevingne</strong></li><li><strong>Jeff Beacher</strong></li><li><strong>Snoop Dogg</strong></li><li><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></li><li><strong>Katy Perry</strong></li><li><strong>Hayden Panettiere</strong></li><li><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to TMZ's report, after Hilton and Richie agreed on a show concept they could star in together, they let the networks and streaming services bid on the project.
