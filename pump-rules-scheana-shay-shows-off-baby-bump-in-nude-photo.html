She shared a sweet clip of herself standing alongside the Australian athlete, 30, writing in the caption, “<a href=# data-link=1>Sweatpants</a> are all that fit me going into 2021 and I couldn’t be happier about it! This year has been a wild ride baby but I’m so happy we got thru it all together!”</p><p>Although Shay and Davies’ <a href=#>baby isn’t due until April</a>, the pair are working hard to prepare. Earlier this month, the California native showed off the progress she and the rugby player had made on <a href=#>their daughter’s nursery</a>. “So this is [the baby’s] new cupboard space,” Davies told fans in the clip, which showed Shay standing before white built-in shelving. “We turned the desk into her new, you know, cloth table.”</p><p>Little progress had been made at the time, but Shay assured viewers it was coming along. She revealed that she and Davies replaced all the drawer knobs with small silver crystal balls and had plans to install a long clothing rack to hold their baby girl’s onesies. Shay was all smiles as she walked through the nursery in an oversized tracksuit and black Nike shoes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shay and Davies <a href=#>announced their pregnancy with baby No. 1</a> in October 2020 after suffering a devastating miscarriage five months prior. “IT’S ALL HAPPENING APRIL 2021!!!,” she captioned her Instagram reveal. “We are expecting our rainbow baby! … The most amazing news of my life!”</p><p>Her boyfriend chimed in with, “We did a thing honey. I’m so happy I have you to balance me out, I love you, honey. Congratulations to us!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaprZ2lerPBy56qZquTnbKiusBmqqGZqWLAqbvWrGSonpZir6Ku2GaZrqWgYravec2um55loJ28tbuO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaclyn-smith-spouse-net-worth-and-her-recent-whereabouts.html><span>←</span><span>Jaclyn Smith Spouse, Net Worth and Her Recent Whereabouts</span></a>
