Bobby V and others can be seen looking onward as the altercation continued to grow, causing someone to intervene. See below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Initially <a href=# data-type=post data-id=267250>Raz commented </a>on The Shade Room‘s Instagram explaining the situation: “I pulled up on Ray J. He pushed and punched me. He’s mad because I have footage that we paid him to direct! Now he say its too violent and not good for the culture! BUT YOU DID IT!!! Now you wanna <a href=# id=auto-tag_fight data-tag=fight>fight</a> me! Is that good for the culture?? – I’m really going to put the footage out NOW! DFG”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Now in a statement to the outlet, the two have reportedly put their minor scuffle behind them, as they are now “operating from a place of love.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Per <a href=# rel=nofollow>TSR</a>, the root of their controversy stemmed from a business disagreement concerning a show that the two heartthrobs are reportedly working on for an undisclosed network. Claims of disagreement on “violent footage” from the show is what sparked the incident. Ray J, who serves as the show’s producer and director, wanted to halt production as Raz-B wanted the show to go on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1428005862.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If the company wants to put the footage out, what can I do if they pay for it?” Raz stated as Ray J followed up with his own explanation saying, “My intention is to help at the end of it all, get all of those people help and guidance.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ray added: “We had a misunderstanding. I didn’t even push him like that. And I’m taking a pic with that girl and that’s why u hear ‘Bobby you should be up here!’ Clearly, you can see her posing for a pic smh. Come on Raz! Damn, I can’t win for losing.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The<a href=# rel=nofollow>Raydemption entertainer </a>also mentioned that their scuffle “wasn’t a big deal” and the two of them are now “operating from a place of love.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Ray J speak more on the altercation between him and Raz-B below as he visited <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234687597>Angela Yee’s WayUp With Yee</a> morning show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6euunnJZqmasl2XerXB0qyjnmWSqsCqusSsqmZpYmiBeH%2BUbGlqZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marnie-schulenburg-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Marnie Schulenburg Obituary</span></a>
