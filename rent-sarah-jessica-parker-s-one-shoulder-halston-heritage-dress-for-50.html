I just thought it was clean, pretty, vibrant. I loved the insane turban <strong>Patricia Field</strong> styled on <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong>'s head and the sweet bag. But that was a costume, so how do you work it for real life? This one shoulder dress is popular on almost everyone and this past spring, summer almost everyone has worn one shape or style in different colors and fabrics. The trend isn't so much of a new thing but what is new the challenge is to figure out how to accessorize it.</p><p>The neckline of this dress is very difficult to work with because it rises higher on the sleeve side of the dress. Ditch a necklace which is going to upset the line of the dress. The bare arm can get a cuff bracelet, a stack of layered bangles work well, too. Stay away from anything that gets lost in the angle of the neckline. Overly ornate <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> or anything chunky around the neck won't work-just keep it simple and elegant. A metallic clutch and a pair of <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> or pumps with a peep toe are a perfect way to give yourself some polish.</p><p><strong>PRODUCT DETAILS</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Halston Heritage Pretty Poncho Dress</a>, $50</p><p>– Pink stretch jersey</p><p>– One shoulder caftan style</p><p>– Gold Halston logo brooch at shoulder</p><p>– Mini length.</p><p>– 37" from top of shoulder to hem</p><p>– Model's height is 5'11"</p><p>– Sized 0-10</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Buy it here</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Not yet a member of Rent the Runway?
