But not to me,” Morgan told her fans. “It was a no-brainer – gravity had taken its toll, I was also exhausted and I needed a ‘pick me up.’”</p><p>The shoe designer gave her surgeon, <strong>Dr. Andrew Jacono</strong>, a shout-out saying he “hit it out of the park” when it came to her new look. Morgan outlined her procedure, calling it a “deep plane” style surgery, which heals fast.</p><p>The New York City plastic surgeon also gushed about Morgan’s before and after results on his Instagram account.</p><p>“I mean I am just blown away by the result of this #deepplanefacelift I performed on @sonjatmorgan of @bravo_rhony,” he <a href=#>wrote on Monday</a>. “We were lucky enough to be able to do the procedure after she completed filming the current season and before COVID hit in New York. So many celebrities look amazing but do not disclose that they have done #plasticsurgery, but I know that her coming forward will empower women who are considering taking control of their appearance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sonja-Morgan-Says-It-Was-a-No-Brainer-Getting-Plastic-Surgery.jpg><p>Jacono added: “Sonja has such beautiful facial structure, high cheek bones, beautiful jawline, and a long elegant neck. She has the perfect ‘scaffolding,’ if you will, so I can give her a gorgeous result. I am humbled that she chose me for her surgery.”</p><p>The Sonja in the City event planner has always been <a href=#>open about her experiences with plastic surgery</a>.</p><p>“In this day and age, the surgery and getting things fixed is part of my self-care,” Morgan told Us Weekly exclusively in August 2019, referring to her use of Botox and other fillers.</p><p>The reality TV star, however, <a href=#>wasn’t a fan of liposuction</a>. “Where I felt in this day and age I went too far is to do liposuction. I don’t think it’s in anymore,” she told Us. “You don’t really need to have that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>former model</a> has since embraced her figure — curves and all.</p><p>“The other day, we filmed the reunion and I had on a tight dress from my collection. And you could see the whole outline of my belly button,” she recalls. “And I did a little walk for <a href=#><strong>Bethenny [Frankel]</strong></a>, and I was like, ‘I don’t care, I love it.’ The curves. This is who I am. This is the way I am right now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaroJ%2BjxrR50qilo5ldoryzs8CnZKCnpGK9ra3SraCcZaOqv6ix0bJkm52WpL%2BmecCnm2aZlqmys3nPopqsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nigerian-musician-mohbad-died-unexpectedly-at-27.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian Musician Mohbad Died Unexpectedly at 27</span></a>
