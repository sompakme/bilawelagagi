Are we ever likely to see a meaningful conflict on the seas again?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Warships - or at least, their ancestors sleeping in the ocean floor - are powerful symbols of past, present and future conflict. A few weeks ago China positioned three ship patrols 12 nautical miles from a contested Japanese-controlled island. The cause? A metaphoric insult — Japanese politicians honoured a controversial war shrine in Tokyo. Again last April, the Red Giant abruptly seized a Japanese cargo ship as payback for an unpaid lease — from <i>1936. </i>Navies today, perhaps more than brute force, project&nbsp;symbolic violence.</p><p>That isn’t to say Type 45 destroyers couldn’t lay a good “siege” if they were so inclined. But in today’s hyperconnected hyperparanoid world,<i> </i>perhaps it’s the<i> </i>threat of a huge navy rather&nbsp;than their actual brute force which gives a country its power. China and Japan, whose ancient hostilities routinely swell around the simple motions of a few coastal vessels, certainly know this all too well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ranked by approximate tonnage of commissioned and active ships, read on to discover which countries stake the greatest claims on the waters today.</p><h2 id=15-royal-netherlands-navy-116-308-tonnes><strong>15. Royal Netherlands Navy: 116,308 tonnes</strong></h2><p>via seaforces.org</p><p>The most powerful Navy of the 17th century once wrote history in the wars of the Dutch Republic. Today it maintains a “peacekeeping” role within NATO and boasts only 23 ships in its arsenal, but the sheer beastliness of anti-air frigates like the De Zeven Provinciën-class at $800 million apiece, and Karel Doorman-class logistic support ships at $400 million, ranks the peaceful Dutch Navy among the most formidable.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-indonesian-navy-142-094-tonnes><strong>14. Indonesian Navy: 142,094 tonnes</strong></h2><p>via commons</p><p>In stark contrast to the Netherlands, Indonesia’s navy consists of more than 150 active ships as of 2009; here, quantity makes for one of the most powerful forces in maritime Southeast Asia. The country maintains modern submarines like the torpedo- and mine-savvy Chang Bogo class, but small gunboats and light attack crafts (corvettes) form the bulk of its numbers, and like the Dutch, a robust arsenal of defence frigates adds serious tonnage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-turkish-navy-148-448-tonnes><strong>13.

In its young days it operated a spread of classic battlecruisers and destroyers which have all since been decommissioned. Frigates, patrol boats and anti-mine vessels dominate the picture now, along with fourteen active attack subs which make Turkey a subsea leader.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-spanish-navy-148-607-tonnes><strong>12.

To this end it consists mostly of massive defence frigates like the&nbsp;modern Tian Dan-class with supersonic anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-sub missiles. Throw in some heavyset destroyers and Taiwan’s navy, with only 50 ships total, has a lion’s roar.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-brazilian-navy-172-190-tonnes><strong>10.

Royal Navy (Britain): 345,400 tonnes</strong></h2><p>No world power owes its status to naval force as much as the United Kingdom. The Royal Navy remained the most powerful in history until the course of the Second World War; during the Cold War it reinvented itself for anti-submarine efforts against the Soviet Union; today, its arsenal boasts versatility. Weapons like the Albion-class amphibious transporter, the Vanguard-class ballistic submarines, and the latest Type 45 guided missile destroyers —&nbsp;<i>$1.7 billion apiece&nbsp;</i>— stake thorough claims on the waters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-indian-navy-381-375-tonnes><strong>5.

Though it barely surpasses the Royal Navy in tonnage it has nearly triple as many active ships; mostly light surface vessels, but a modified Russian Kiev-class Aircraft carrier weighing <i>45,400 tonnes</i> among them. Nevertheless the Indian Navy faces difficulties under water.

Standouts: two 10,000-tonne Atago-class guided missile destroyers—massive for destroyer standards—and one 27,000 tonne Izumo-class helicopter carrier. Currently relegated to an international “peacekeeping” capacity, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force specializes in antisubmarine and minesweeping, though lacks in antiaircraft defence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-people-s-liberation-army-navy-china-896-445-tonnes><strong>3. People’s Liberation Army Navy (China): 896,445 tonnes</strong></h2><p>via absoluterights.com</p><p>The greatest consensus in military academia — to say nothing of certainty — over China’s war capacity approaches <i>quantity over quality. </i>At 377 commissioned ships, the most in the world, the quantity is certainly accounted for. You might imagine China’s fleet, then, to be a rusting second-hand lot out of the Soviet Union era. But a glance at the figures suggests otherwise.</p><p>Every commissioned ship boasts Made in China barring one aircraft carrier and a single class of destroyer and submarine, and all 15 active corvette vessels (small, fast attack-crafts) were christened no earlier than last year. By some measures the <i>second </i>largest navy in the world, the Red Giant’s military potential remains enigmatic to the West.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-russian-navy-927-120-tonnes><strong>2.

Russia’s very newest destroyer, Sovremennyy-class, is almost twenty years old. Its oldest is nearly fifty. Submarines are more promising; old fogeys like the Delta III share space with the very latest in sophistication — the nuclear-powered Borei-class ballistic missile launchers. While the material lags, the Russian Navy’s commitment to overhaul is, perhaps, its most noteworthy feature.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-united-states-navy-3-378-758-tonnes><strong>1. United States Navy: 3,378,758 tonnes</strong></h2><p>via secureworldexpo.com</p><p>Taking a look at the US Navy’s catalogue, you might be struck by how completely its active warships run the gamut of commission dates. With about 270 total, there’s a handful born every single year from at least as far back as 1970. This reveals, if not a certain pathology of defence spending, the consistency with which the US has and will continue to bloat its abominably large military.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What <i>is</i> the military-industrial complex?
