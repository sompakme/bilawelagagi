The Couples Retreat star, 53, turned it down after reading Carrie’s description, which said she had “the body of <a href=#><strong>Heather Locklear</strong></a> and the mind of Dorothy Parker.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Melrose Place alum revealed that she thought she would never have a body like Locklear’s and although she thought Carrie was “fantastic” she knew she wanted to play Charlotte, even if she started off as a recurring character and not a series regular.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Kim Cattrall</a></strong>, who played Samantha Jones, was also indecisive about committing to a TV role at first. Star cast actress Lou Thornton for the role but later convinced Cattrall to join the series instead, and <strong><a href=#>Cynthia Nixon</a></strong> also signed on to play Miranda Hobbes to shake off her past as a child star. Once the Divorce actress agreed to be on the show, the four actresses headed to Manhattan in June 1997 to shoot the pilot.</p><p>Sex and the City aired for six seasons from 1998 to 2004 and the actresses reprised their roles in the 2008 film of the same name and its sequel in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqesF2Wu6V506GcZpuZqcZusMCrqZ6mXajBor6MqJ2fnaKasW630aKqraGeYrGiwsisZJyZoqe2pnnRqKOeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vijayakanth-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Vijayakanth Cause of Death</span></a>
