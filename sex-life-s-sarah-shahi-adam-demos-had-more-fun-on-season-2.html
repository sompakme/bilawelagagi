Sarah Shahi and Adam Demos leaned into their real-life romance while filming season 2 of Sex/Life.
“I think with Adam and Sarah, they feel safe together and they’re very comfortable with each other,” Sex/Life intimacy coordinator, Casey Hudecki, exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, March 6. “I think in their scenes, they’re free to have a lot more fun and play with each other.”
Hudecki — who also worked with the actors on season 1, which filmed in fall 2020 before they were officially an item — noted that she still had to help Shahi, 43, and Demos, 37, during their on-camera sex scenes."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The actors play Billie Connelly and Brad Simon, respectively on the Netflix series.</p><p>“They’re a delight,” Hudecki told Us of <a href=#>the real-life couple</a>. “We didn’t get to do very much with the two of them this season. So every time we did it was very easy.”</p><p>The Canadian-based fight director added: “They were like, ‘Yep, we know this, we know that we know this.’ We had a very nice shorthand.”</p><p>Shahi and Demos confirmed their romance on New Year’s Eve in 2020 after meeting on the set of the Netflix drama earlier that year. The relationship came a few months after <a href=#>Us exclusively confirmed</a> in June 2020 that <a href=#>the Texas native split from husband <strong>Steve Howey</strong></a> after 11 years of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sarah-Shahi-and-Adam-Demos-Were-%E2%80%98Free-to-Have-a-Lot-More-Fun-and-Play-on-%E2%80%98Sex-Life-Season-2-Says-Intimacy-Coordinator-2.jpg><p>The L Word alum, who shares <a href=#>son William, 13, and twins Violet and Knox, 8</a>, with the <a href=#>Shameless</a> alum, 45, <a href=#>finalized her divorce in January 2021</a>.</p><p>Later that month, Demos gushed over Shahi on her birthday. “Happy bday my baby, I f*#kin love you. You’re everything,” he wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><p>The Black Adam actress <a href=#>returned the favor on Demos’ special day</a> in May 2021. “I do know I found my forever. I do know I’ve never loved deeper, harder, more ferociously,” Shahi wrote via social media. “I do know I’m overly grateful for him. I do know I’ve loved him for a thousand lifetimes before and will love him for a thousand lifetimes more.”</p><p>The couple confirmed they are still going strong by <a href=#>packing on the PDA</a> at the February premiere of <a href=#>Sex/Life season 2</a> in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sex/Life season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqesF2htqex0maqmqqRnXq0tMChoGaZlJa6brDEpqasZZiWsW65zqucZp6lo3qwuoysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-rodrigo-net-worth-how-much-is-rodrigo-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Rodrigo Net Worth How Much is Rodrigo Worth?</span></a>
