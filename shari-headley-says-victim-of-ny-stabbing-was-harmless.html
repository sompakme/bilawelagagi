It took me the entire day to get it together because I do have to work, but I was crying. You can hear my voice, it is a little bit hoarse,” Headley told <a href=# rel=nofollow>NY1</a> Thursday (March 23). “I was crying because I just don’t get it., I just don’t get it.”</p><p>The two met in 1991 when Headly starred on the soap series All My Children. Caughman was a big fan of the actress’ work and made sure to tune into her weekly live stream with fans. He also mentioned her quite frequently on his Twitter account (@<a href=# rel=nofollow>TimRock715</a>) which he proudly showed off his impressive collection of photos with celebrities.&nbsp;“What kind of world are we living in right now?” she shared with the<a href=# rel=nofollow> New York Times</a>. “What a harmless guy. He spends his days just wanting to take pictures with celebrities.”</p><p>The former youth mentor and college graduate was stabbed by Jackson March 17. The 28-year-old told police he traveled from Baltimore to New York to kill black men, especially those who dated white women.“He told the cops, ‘I’ve hated black men since I was a kid,” a law enforcement official said. “‘I’ve had these feelings since I was a young person. I hate black men,'”Jackson was arraigned on a charge of murder as a hate crime and will be held without bail.</p><p>Headley says even though their friendship sprouted on social media,&nbsp;Caughman’s death still had an effect on her. “Even though it is through social media and meeting him as a fan, it still hits home,” she said. “It is somebody that you know or know of.”</p><p>Caughman was also a big fan of Oprah, Beyonce, Wyclef Jean and Chuck Berry. When the rock icon’s death was reported on March 18,&nbsp;Caughman tweeted his love for Berry along with Prince and John Lennon. “Rest in peace John, Chuck, Prince all of you,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX52ut7GMoZivnV2jvLW%2FjKyrmqpdqLWivshmn56ZlKGyunnToqSorJiueqSt1KCfppmeYoF6hJdqaWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-olivera-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Olivera Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
