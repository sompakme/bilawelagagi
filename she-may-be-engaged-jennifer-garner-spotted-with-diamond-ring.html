The publication refers to it as an “eternity band” gifted to the actress by her boyfriend, John Miller.</p><p>Jennifer and John first sparked romance rumors in October 2018, but they’ve maintained a relatively low-profile since then. They don’t discuss their relationship to the press or post photos of each other to social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But engagement rumors have followed the couple before. In 2021, fans were <a href=#>convinced Jen was engaged</a> when she did an Instagram Live wearing a sparkler on her ring finger. The couple never confirmed an engagement, so it was assumed to be a false alarm.</p><p>Nonetheless, sources at the time said the couple were serious about each other. “Jen and John aren’t flashy about their romance,” a source told OK! “But they are madly in love.”</p><p>So far, there’s been no comment from Jen on the recent engagement rumors.</p><p>The Alias alum was previously married to Ben Affleck from 2005 to 2018. They share three children, a son and two daughters.</p><p>Ben has been in the headlines a lot this year for his marriage to J-Lo. The couple rekindled their romance nearly two decades after calling off their first engagement. Jen and Ben sealed the deal with an intimate Las Vegas ceremony in the summer, followed by a larger celebration at his Georgia compound.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their union was the subject of a lot of speculation, especially around the topic of a pre-nup. Prior to their original wedding (that was called off), Ben and J.Lo reportedly signed a pre-nup that had <a href=#>stipulations in the case of infidelity</a>.</p><p>"The prenuptial agreement is to protect both their assets and says that if they do split, they keep their own money, except if Ben cheats,” a source told <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> at the time.</p><p>“What she does want is for Ben to give her some guarantee that he will never cheat again,” the insider continued.</p><p>However, following their wedding in July, it was reported that Ben and Jen <a href=#>decided not to sign a prenup</a> this time around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Amid Divorce, Sylvester Stallone & Jennifer Flavin Have No Prenup</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Hello Magazine</a>, <a href=#>OK!
