And sure, they have the right to not listen to my music. … But what’s happening now is they are protesting, they’re showing up at the Chamber, they made comments online and to the Chamber that they will be holding protests at the show, which is just so disheartening.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Adam-Mac-Withdraws-From-Music-Festival-After-Being-Asked-if-Performance-Is-Promoting-Homosexuality-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Mac wore <a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a>’ “Lunatic Country Music Person” merch in the video, which she released last year<a href=#> in response to a Fox News dis</a>s about her LGBTQ+ allyship. He debated what was “the right thing to do” about his festival appearance.</p><p class=p1>“A part of me feels like it would be letting down the people that need to see me most there in that space and the people that were so excited for me to come home and put on a show,” he added. “It also feels like [if I don’t perform, then] I’m caving and letting those people win, which is not something I like to do.”</p><p class=p1>Mac ultimately decided that the “best way forward” was to cancel the show and allow organizers to book a less “controversial” act in his place. “I’m really sad about it,” he concluded. “I’m working on trying to figure out a way to do something else to make it right. I really, really wanted to be there.”</p><p class=p1>Logan County Tobacco & Heritage Festival organizers have not publicly addressed Mac’s claims nor revealed the replacement headliner for their “grand finale concert” next month.</p><p class=p1>Mac also shared his cancellation statement via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, where he was met with support from several fellow country stars.</p><p class=p1>“You are loved. I’m sorry this happened but glad you’re sharing it here,” Morris, 33, replied, to which Mac sent back a tree and a fire emoji in an apparent nod to her new EP, <i>The Bridge</i>, about <a href=#>burning down the male-dominated industry</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong> </a>also chimed in, writing, “This is heartbreaking and so disappointing. I’m really sorry. You’ve got your army in these comments <span class=s1>🤍</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Mac later gushed that he was overcome with emotion after seeing his “fav ally queens” show up in his corner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqippeav26tw5qkZqWRmHqkrc2cnKWrXaLCtLXCZp2eq6Sew6K4jKycrWWRm8Gmvoyao6Wdl5qxbrTOpqapoJ%2BXtqJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaquille-o-neal-wants-his-kids-to-understand-respectable-nepotism.html><span>←</span><span>Shaquille O'Neal Wants His Kids to Understand 'Respectable Nepotism'</span></a>
