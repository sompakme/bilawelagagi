<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Southern Charms Craig: Naomie, Whitney Hooked Up More Times</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There’s more where that came from! <a href=#><strong>Craig Conover</strong></a> hinted that <a href=#><strong>Naomie Olindo</strong> and <strong>Whitney Sudler-Smith</strong>’s hookup</a> was not a one-time occurrence.</p><p>“It wasn’t a short-lived thing,” the <a href=#>Southern Charm</a> star, 33, exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, August 22, while promoting season 8 of the series. “I definitely know that.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Sewing Down South founder</a> teased, “They definitely filmed a lot more than what you’ve seen so far. So, I’m kind of excited with everyone else to see, you know, Whitney dating someone.”</p><p>Naomie, 29, revealed during the <a href=#>Thursday, August 18, episode of Southern Charm</a> that she and Whitney, 54, made out after the group’s <a href=#>puppy nuptials for Peaches and Little Craig</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Southern-Charms-Craig-Conover-Teases-Naomie-Olindo-and-Whitney-Sudler-Smiths-Hook-Up-Wasnt-a-One-Time-Thing2.jpg><p>“Speaking of the dog wedding, I didn’t tell you, but right after, I did kiss Whitney,” <a href=#>the France native</a> confessed to her costars<a href=#><strong> Leva Bonaparte</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Austen Kroll</strong></a>. “It was fun. … He spent the night here.”</p><p>Leva, 43, was shocked by the omission, saying, “You were, like, spooning with Whitney and you didn’t f—king tell me?”</p><p>The pair’s chemistry became even more apparent <a href=#>during the crew’s trip to Yemassee, South Carolina</a>, which is when Craig learned about the fling. “That stinks. [To] go from me to Whitney,” he told Austen, 35, after hearing about the hookup. “It’s just not that fun.”</p><p>The Delaware native — who <a href=#>dated Naomie for three years before their 2017 split</a> and hooked up with her again<a href=#> in the summer of 2021</a> — told Us on Monday that he was definitely surprised by the news.</p><p>“I remember laughing so hard. And being told that I needed to get serious,” Craig explained to Us. “I thought it was gonna be great TV and … I couldn’t wait for it to, like, come out. [It] was a good secret that everyone kept.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Pillows and Beer” podcast cohost</a>, however, noted that his reaction during the group’s trip was somewhat misleading. While he did say he was “disappointed” that Whitney broke the “bro-code” by hooking up with his ex-girlfriend, he told Us he was responding to “how absurd the situation seemed” at the time.</p><p>“There’s a few factors there that make it absurd,” he revealed on Monday, pointing out, “I’m not entitled to an opinion about either of them or what they do. But when <a href=#>one of my friends dates someone</a>, they move into, like, the family member column for me. But it’s been a long time.”</p><p>The law school graduate added that Naomie moving on with Whitney “wasn’t really the issue.” It was the legitimacy of their hookup that threw him for a loop.</p><p>“I think I was shocked to find out it was real. There was a lot of talk before it, and I was just, like, ‘This is so bizarre,’” Craig continued. “I think that’s fair to say. I think it’s OK for me to think it’s wild, just like everyone else.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Pillow Talk author</a>, for his part, moved on with <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a> in late 2021. Their romance has been featured on season 6 of <a href=#>Summer House</a>, season 8 of Southern Charm and will continue into season 2 of <a href=#>Winter House</a>.</p><p>“It’s funny to watch our relationships progress,” Craig told Us, noting that this season of the Charleston-based series <a href=#>“was the very beginning” of their romance</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Southern Charm airs on Bravo Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdqHqkvsCinmamkaS6qrGMsJ%2BirJ6axm60zqiinpxdqr1uuc6rnGasmaKytHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./margueritte-aozasa-husband-mykell-bates-was-a-former-santa-clara-assistant-coach.html><span>←</span><span>Margueritte Aozasa Husband Mykell Bates Was A Former Santa Clara Assistant Coach</span></a>
