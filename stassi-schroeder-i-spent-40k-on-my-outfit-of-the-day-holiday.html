Honestly, that’s so cringe,” the former <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> star, 34, revealed during the Wednesday, June 14, episode of the “<a href=#>Call Her Daddy</a>” podcast.</p><p>In 2018, Schroeder decided to create the holiday based on her <a href=#>popular #OOTD posts</a> on social media. The idea was inspired based on her daily routine where she would <a href=#>show off her look</a> and would encourage her followers to do the same. According to the Bravo alum, she explained that she had to purchase the date — which was June 30 — because “you don’t just get to own holidays for free.”</p><p>“I think it was like $40,000,” she confessed. “No, it is so embarrassing, and you guys, I would not do it again. I would never just <a href=#>throw away that money</a> to have a holiday.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stassi-Schroeder-Admits-She-Paid-40K-to-Own-Her-Outfit-of-the-Day-National-Holiday-388.jpg><p>At the time of the hefty purchase, Schroeder believed she was making a <a href=#>good investment for her career</a>.</p><p>“I was just in business mode, my book was coming out,” she said during the Wednesday appearance. “I’m like, ‘I think that this is <a href=#>good branding</a> so it’s like I’m putting money into my career.’ That’s how I felt.”</p><p>However, the <a href=#>Next Level Basic author</a> learned one year after buying the holiday that she would have to pay that amount again to retain ownership.</p><p>“You own it for a year, and I didn’t know that. And so the next year came around and they were like you gotta pay for it again and I think it was just the same amount of money,” she recalled. “I’m like, ‘You’re out of your f—ing mind, this is a lifetime commitment. You think I’m gonna spend this every year?’ So now technically on the list, if you were to search it, my name isn’t up there anymore.”</p><p>After the hard lesson, Schroeder expressed her remorse for the business decision. She admitted she didn’t care if people came for her because she “deserves” it and had a lot of respect for those who “came up” with the idea of buying a national holiday.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the New Orleans native idea for her own holiday didn’t pan out, she has flourished in her personal life. Schroeder and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Beau Clark</strong></a>, are <a href=#>expecting their second child</a>. (The couple, who <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 2020 and 2022, share 2-year-old daughter Hartford.)</p><p>On Monday, June 12, the <a href=#>former reality star</a> posed nude for her maternity shoot <a href=#>ahead of baby No. 2’s arrival</a>. “Manifesting a well-adjusted mama’s boy,” she captioned the series of photos via <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6jBor%2FSomSsm5invKawxKtkomWjpbKvwIxtZ6Rln6N6rsWMqKytnpmperCyjK2fnmWUlsZutM6loJ2ZqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophia-bush-net-worth-how-much-is-bush-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sophia Bush Net Worth How Much is Bush Worth?</span></a>
