He valued family, friends, and community above all else, and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In early May 2023, Allison opened up to the same <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>outlet</a> about her husband’s passing for the first time. “No one had any inkling that he was low. He didn’t want people to know,” she said. “He just wanted to be everyone’s Superman and protector.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1147026310.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Mrs. Boss shed some light on her&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Move with Kindness Foundation</a>, a campaign she founded to support mental health initiatives. She continued speaking about her desire to aid those suffering silently in<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> honor of her husband</a> and her “new purpose.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We always hear, ‘Reach out to the strongest people,’ and I believe in that. But I also want the messaging to be that if you’re feeling low or depressed, it’s okay to lean on someone else,” she says. “Trust that people are still going to see you as that light even in your darkest moments.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If I’m honest, when this happened, I was confused with what my new purpose was going to be. Then, I spoke to my friend, Andy Grammer, and I expressed to him, ‘How am I going to still live out what I know is my purpose, love, and joy, and has always been my family’s purpose?’ He said, ‘Allison, it’s still your purpose. It looks a bit different now — and it’s a little more depth-filled.’ I’ll never forget that conversation because I feel like I knew it inside of me, but hearing it from a friend that I still have that purpose is helping me move forward as well.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Along with his wife, Stephen “tWitch” Boss is survived by their three children Zaia, 3, Maddox, 6, and Weslie, 14.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">If you or someone you know may be contemplating&nbsp;suicide, please contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 9-8-8, or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jBprzHnqVmrKeewaS0jJumrKtdlsK1u8%2BssGZpYmiBeIKPaXBqZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-theroux-supports-ex-jennifer-aniston-s-hair-brand.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Theroux Supports Ex Jennifer Anistons Hair Brand</span></a>
