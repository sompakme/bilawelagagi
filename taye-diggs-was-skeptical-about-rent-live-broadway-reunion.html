At first, I didn’t want to do it because I thought it might be cheesy. But when I got there, I really was surprised. I had a good time. I saw all of my old-ass friends, and they still look really good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Taye-Diggs-Didnt-Want-to-Do-Rent-Live.jpg><p>He continued: “Motherf—king Rent. It was so surreal. It was really surreal watching really young people play the part. They could have been all of our children.”</p><p>The All-American star reunited with original Rent stars <strong>Anthony Rapp</strong>, <strong>Adam Pascal</strong>, <strong>Daphne Rubin-Vega</strong>, <strong>Jesse L. Martin</strong>, <strong>Wilson Jermaine Heredia</strong>, <strong>Fredi Walker</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Idina Menzel</strong></a> — to whom Diggs was married from 2003 to 2014 — to sing “Seasons of Love” during Sunday’s broadcast.</p><p>For the live FOX event, their roles were played by Mario, <a href=#><strong>Jordan Fisher</strong></a>, <strong>Brennin Hunt</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Tinashe</strong></a>, <strong>Brandon Victor Dixon</strong>, <strong>Valentina</strong>, <strong>Kiersey Clemons</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a>, respectively. Hunt had <a href=#>broken his ankle during a dress rehearsal</a>, so much of Sunday broadcast was pre-recorded, but the closing number and the Broadway reunion was all filmed live.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Menzel also hailed the experience via Instagram on Sunday night, filming a clip backstage alongside Walker and Rubin-Vega, as well as <strong>Tracie Thoms</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Rosario Dawson,</strong></a> who appeared in the film. “I just want to say for those who just rocked it, you were awesome,” Menzel, 47, told the new cast.</p><p>In another clip, the Wicked alum described Rent Live as a “great experience,” adding, “Hope you all liked it. It was great to be back with the family and meet lots of new people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZVisaqzxqxksJmjYsCssc%2BtoJyZnGKuo7vUrWSrnZ6peq211Z5km6qflrG4rdhmqZ6tnp68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noodles-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Noodles Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
