She said, "You know, Katie Couric is one of my favorite people because she said to me she had heard a quote that she loved, that said, 'There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.'"</p><p>During the Golden Globes, Fey and Poehler joked that Sam Michael Fox best stay away from Taylor Swift. “You know what Taylor Swift? You stay away from Michael J Fox’s son,” said Fey. “Or go for it,” Poehler replied. “No, she needs some me-time to learn about herself."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Bonds With Travis Kelce’s Mom At His NFL Game Amid Dating Rumors</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were surprised by Swift's response.

It was a lighthearted joke."</p><p>Poehler added, "Aw, I feel bad if she was upset. I am a feminist, and she is a young and talented girl. That being said, I do agree I am going to hell. But for other reasons. Mostly boring tax stuff."</p><p>It seems like the feud may have quietly ended when Poehler and Swift were asked to present together.

It is so WEIRD to me that it’s only ever a problem for Taylor. I think it’s out of pure envy that she is as insanely successful as she is. It’s always been a trend to hate on Taylor. Nearly EVERY artist writes about love & heartbreak, hardly any of them are able to add the storytelling element to it the way Taylor does."</p><p>Clearly, fans of Taylor weren't impressed with the jab.</p><h2 id=tina-fey-39-s-past-words-with-amy-poehler-recently-resurfaced-during-jimmy-fallon-39-s-toxic-workplace-allegations>Tina Fey's Past Words With Amy Poehler Recently Resurfaced During Jimmy Fallon's Toxic Workplace Allegations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tina-fey-and-amy-poehler.jpg><p>Following Jimmy Fallon's toxic workplace allegations, several past interviews and quotes started to emerge.

Amy was in the middle of some such nonsense with Seth Meyers across the table, and she did something vulgar as a joke. I can't remember what it was exactly, except it was dirty and loud and 'unladylike.'"</p><p>"Jimmy Fallon turned to her and in a faux-squeamish voice said, 'Stop that! It's not cute! I don't like it.' Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him. 'I don't f------ care if you like it.' Jimmy was visibly startled."</p><p>Fey went on to reveal that Poehler was making her intent on the show obvious from the start. "Amy made it clear that she wasn't there to be cute. She wasn't there to play wives and girlfriends in the boys' scenes. She was there to do what she wanted to do and she did not care if you like it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, Poehler hasn't been afraid to speak her mind throughout her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkay4uK3RnaOyZZiWsW7Azmanq52jmru1ecCnZJqvkaexbsPIrZ9mmZ2uerG7xKGjnqpdmbK0vMitnGaglad6ssHErKuip56Wr62xjKmYrKxdrLa1tIytn55lk6S6prDImqVmmZ6ZerW1zZpkn52pZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./southern-charm-s-craig-naomie-whitney-hooked-up-more-times.html><span>←</span><span>Southern Charms Craig: Naomie, Whitney Hooked Up More Times</span></a>
