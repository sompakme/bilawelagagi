Apparently, Travis is also pushing for Taylor to accompany him to another festival, Neon Lights, and their security is trying to organize with the festival planners to ensure her safety.</p><p>"Travis loves Coachella and he was keen to go to Neon, it's the biggest after-party of the weekend," a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">source told The U.S. Sun</a>.
