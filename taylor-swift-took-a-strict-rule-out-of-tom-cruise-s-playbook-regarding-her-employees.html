Nonetheless, both have certain rules in common. Your Tango listed some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor's strict rules employees have to follow</a>.</p><p>Among the list included employees have to sign an NDA, so that they don't leak any info about what goes on behind the scenes. In 2014, Swift had journalists sign an NDA after listening to 1989 prior to its release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-wearing-black-onstage.jpg><p>Your Tango also mentions that celebs making employees sign NDAs really isn't anything new.</p><p>The publication writes, "Rumor has it that all of Swift’s intimate partners must sign a non-disclosure agreement. It’s no surprise that she holds her employees to the same standards. It’s common practice for companies to require NDAs from all of their employees."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Swift is no different and is smart for making them sign on the dotted line. With so many people in close proximity to the star, it’s necessary that she make sure her copyrights and secrets are safe."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Applauded The Way Taylor Swift Saved Dave Grohl At Paul McCartney's Party</a></span></p><p>As for Tom Cruise, he does the same. In fact, <a href=#>Cruise even made the nannies sign an NDA</a>. Celebrity nanny Suzanne Hansen revealed, “Tom would make his nannies sign confidentiality agreements that were so strict, they couldn’t even say for whom they were working. So basically, if (Cruise) went on camera and said how he didn’t have any help raising his children, they couldn’t say anything.”</p><p>Tom has also been very private about his personal life, so this should not come as a surprise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-don-39-t-believe-a-certain-taylor-swift-rule-that-alleges-she-forces-her-celeb-friends-to-attend-her-shows>Fans Don't Believe A Certain Taylor Swift Rule That Alleges She Forces Her Celeb Friends To Attend Her Shows</h2><p>Fans don't agree with all of Taylor Swift's rules. In fact, fans don't believe that Taylor Swift enforces a certain rule to begin with. It was said that Swift forces her celebrity friends to attend concerts as a way to get more exposure. Given Swift's insane popularity and success, this one is very hard to believe. It is likely that friends of Taylor's likely take part to experience her shows and, if anything, they themselves might want the exposure of appearing at a Taylor Swift show.</p><p><a href=#>Fans completely disagreed with the rule</a>. One fan wrote, "Omg the whole "she forces her celebrity friends to attend at least one of her concerts." I'm sorry but Taylor is not like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift And Her Team Banned A Major TV Network's Request To Play Her Music, And It Was All Because Of Travis Kelce</a></span></p><p>Fans also completely disagreed with another alleged rule that Swift charges fans to meet her backstage. Obviously, that one is completely false, especially given all the fans Swift has met throughout her career, along with the surprise appearances. Swift clearly does this out of the goodness of her heart.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-39-s-rules-seem-to-be-much-more-severe-for-his-staff-to-follow>Tom Cruise's Rules Seem To Be Much More Severe For His Staff To Follow</h2><p>Tom Cruise's rules seem to be a lot more severe. The star apparently has <a href=#>strict rules for his homes fans don't even believe</a>, which includes military precision security rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-14t102508-634.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, <a href=#>he won't hesitate to fire someone on his team</a> if they don't agree with his vision. Matt Damon retold the story of a coordinator questioning a certain stunt Cruise had planned. Disagreeing with Tom wasn't the best idea.</p><p>Damon revealed, "I remember I had dinner with him once, and it was after he did the [Mission: Impossible movie] where he ran around the building. And I go, ‘Can you tell me how that happened?’ And he’s a really intense guy, and he was like, ‘I’ll tell you how it happened!’ I go, ‘Alright.’ And I’m in."</p><p>"He goes, ‘I’ve been thinking about this shot for 15 years!’ And I’m like, ‘Wow, really?’ He goes, ‘So I go to the safety guy, and I lay it all out.’ Safety guy goes, ‘We can’t do that. It’s too dangerous, you can’t do that. So I get a new safety guy.’ That’s the beginning of his story."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Never a dull moment when it comes to Cruise working his craft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lpKS8rHnAZqqtqpmYwW66w5pkq62cmnqwwdNmpp9lpKS6bq%2FRrqCsnaNiva2t2JumqKNdp7KordGdoKefXZ2ys3nEpqelp6masrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikita-reznikova-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Nikita Reznikova Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
