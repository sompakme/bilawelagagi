Tonkin portrayed Cleo from 2006 to 2010, while Holt played Emma from 2006 to 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Originals-Claire-Holt-Phoebe-Tonkin-Reunite-001.jpg><p>The Australian actresses later transitioned to The Originals, on which Holt took on the role of Rebekah Mikaelson and Tonkin played Hayley Marshall from 2013 to 2018.</p><p>The <a href=#>Affair</a> alum reflected on her lasting friendship with Holt during a 2014 fan event. “Claire was, like, the first person obviously that I told [about landing the part of Hayley],” she explained at the time. “I was 15 years old when I met Claire; she was 16. We were both in the Gold Coast, which is a beach town in Sydney, for years. And then, when I moved to L.A., I actually stayed on Claire’s couch when I was auditioning. And she was like, ‘This is the local coffee place.’ She really showed me the ropes of Los Angeles.”</p><p>As such, Tonkin was thrilled to reunite with the 47 Meters Down star on The Vampire Diaries and its spinoff The Originals. “When I found out I was coming on Vampire Diaries and I told her, I think she was just so excited to have a buddy in Atlanta,” she recalled. “And then, of course, when we had The Originals, it was just, like, great. Now we just both exclusively do TV shows together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Holt, meanwhile, got nostalgic for her time on The Originals in February, posting several behind-the-scenes photos via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Are photo dumps still a thing?” she asked her followers. “TOGS edition.” She shared pics with Tonkin, <strong>Charles Michael Davis</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Daniel Gillies</strong></a>, <strong>Riley Voelkel</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Joseph Morgan</strong></a> and more of her costars.</p><p>Voelkel, 30, and Davis, 36, each left three heart emojis in the comments section at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVivLO1xqKlmqSjYrCtrcirnGagn6HBbrzHqJybnV2pvK%2B3yKdkq52lo7a1sYyjpqSdXZavsMHTZp9rp18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-dark-truth-about-bill-cosby-and-hugh-hefner-s-alleged-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>The Dark Truth About Bill Cosby And Hugh Hefner's Alleged Relationship</span></a>
