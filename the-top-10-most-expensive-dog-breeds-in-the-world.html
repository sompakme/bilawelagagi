These dog breeds are the costliest of them all. Here now is a list of the top 10 most expensive dog breeds in the world.</p><h2 id=1-lowchen---7-000><b>1. Lowchen - $7,000</b></h2><p>Also known as the Little Lion Dog, the Lowchen is one of the most rare dog breeds in the world. New registrations of this dog every year number only in the hundreds.&nbsp; The modern sources of this breed originate from Germany, Belgium and France. It is a very friendly dog and possesses a regal look like the lion. It has the right-sized head that is characterized by a wide skull, short muzzle, round eyes and pendulant ears. It has a long and flowing coat and can live up to 14 years.&nbsp; It is active and very playful. Combined with its intelligence, it makes a good pet dog.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-rottweiler---7-000><b>2. Rottweiler - $7,000</b></h2><p>The Rottweiler is a fairly common breed, but champion lines used for dog shows may fetch up to $7,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was originally used for herding cattle, though it eventually evolved to become a multi-faceted dog that can be used for search-and-rescue missions, guide for the blind or as police and guard dogs. It is generally good-natured and placid, though it may not be welcoming of strangers because of its territorial and watchdog instincts.</p><h2 id=3-samoyed---6-500><b>3. Samoyed - $6,500</b></h2><p>Also known as the Bjelkier, the Samoyed originally comes from Siberia where it was used for herding and pulling sleds. It has a happy expression and a friendly disposition, making it an excellent pet for kids. It is also very playful, though its herding instinct means that it has a tendency to pull in a different direction. Do not attempt to make a Samoyed a guard dog because aggressiveness is not in its blood. It can make for a good watchdog, however, because it is diligent enough to bark at anything or anyone that approaches its territory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-german-shepherd---6-500><b>4. German Shepherd - $6,500</b></h2><p>One of the most registered dog breeds, the German Shepherd is a large dog that is very loyal and protective of its owners. It originated in Germany in 1899 and it was initially used for herding, guarding and protecting sheep. It is very active and self-assured. It is known for its intelligence, as it has the ability to learn a command after only five repetitions and can obey an order around 95 percent of the time. It is always willing to learn and eager to have a purpose. While it is not the type that will be immediately friendly with strangers, a German Shepherd is highly obedient. It makes excellent guard dogs and is highly sought after by the police and military to help them in their search missions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-canadian-eskimo-dog---6-000><b>5. Canadian Eskimo Dog - $6,000</b></h2><p>This dog is indigenous to North America. It is one of the oldest purebred domestic dogs in the continent. It is powerful and athletic, with an impressive built and imposing appearance. It shares the look of an American wolf, though the dog’s tail has more curves and is generally shorter. It is known to be loyal, tough, alert, brave and intelligent. Its affectionate and gentle nature enables it to have a strong bond with its owner. The Canadian Eskimo Dog also has a strong prey drive brought about by its hunting instinct.</p><h2 id=6-tibetan-mastiff---5-000><b>6. Tibetan Mastiff - $5,000</b></h2><p>The Tibetan Mastiff is a primitive breed that originated in Central Asia. It was originally used for herding and guarding. It is intelligent, powerful and strong-willed. It is not friendly to strangers, so owners must train the dog to socialize. It is known to be tenacious, as it was originally used to confront predators in the wilds.&nbsp; It is nocturnal in nature, meaning it can sleep the whole day to allow it to be aware and alert at night. It makes a good guard and watchdog because it would bark at the slightest sounds made in the dark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-chinese-crested-hairless---5-000><b>7. Chinese Crested Hairless - $5,000</b></h2><p>The Chinese Crested hairless dog is a small dog that has a single coat of fur. This is against the Chinese Crested powderpuff that has double coating. Both can appear in the same litter. The hairless variety may be a true hairless that has no body hair at all or may be a hairy hairless that possesses a full coat if left untrimmed. It is susceptible to pimples, dryness and sunburn.</p><h2 id=8-akita---3-500><b>8. Akita - $3,500</b></h2><p>The Akita has two main varieties, the Japanese and the American versions. The Japanese strain may come in white, brindle, sesame, fawn or red, while the American strain can come in any color. It is big, strong and dominant, thus making it unadvisable for first-time dog owners. It can be aggressive towards other dogs unless it is properly trained to socialize. While it may be reserved to strangers and territorial in nature, the Akita is also known to be loyal and affectionate to its owner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-pharaoh-hound---3-000><b>9. Pharaoh Hound - $3,000</b></h2><p>The Pharaoh Hound is normally linked to ancient Egypt, but it is actually native to Malta where it is traditionally used by the Maltese for hunting rabbits. It is graceful, elegant, powerful and athletic. It is also highly intelligent, albeit, independent-minded to the point of being stubborn. It has a strong prey drive and should always be kept on a leash.</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h2 id=10-chow-chow---3-000><b>10. Chow Chow - $3,000</b></h2><p>The Chow Chow looks like a puffy lion and comes from China. It has an impressive built featuring a square profile and broad skull. It has thick hair and curly tail. It is considered a high-risk dog however because of the number of fatal dog bites attributed to it. It is protective of its owners and property, meaning it may not be friendly to strangers and other people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGasn6V6cnyMpqasrF2axbGxzaygr51dmbyoecGrnJ6co2K2r3nToZxmr5%2BnuaV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronnie-ortiz-magro-granted-protection-order-against-jen-harley.html><span>←</span><span>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Granted Protection Order Against Jen Harley</span></a>
