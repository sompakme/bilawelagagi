From the co-passenger who would not shut up to that first-timer who filled up a barf bag, or to that insensitive guy in front who reclines the chair all the way down to your knees as if he wants you to give him a shave, or that stupid kid behind you who would not stop kicking your chair. There are also countless stories of airline food that rivals hospital food, or flight attendants who do everything but attend to your needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe you are just in the wrong airline. There are some who can provide you with some of the most luxurious accommodations similar to that of a five-star hotel.

And of course, the airline has always been known for it’s a la carte menu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=2-cathay-pacific-airways-limited><b>2. Cathay Pacific Airways Limited</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may not be that popular in the United States, but Cathay Pacific certainly provides luxurious accommodations in its aircrafts. The airline offers Elemis amenity kits and sleepwear that was designed by Shanghai Tang. Passengers also get several options for their audio and video entertainment.
