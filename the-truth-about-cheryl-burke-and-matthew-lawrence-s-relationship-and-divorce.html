Matthew was there for Cheryl when she was going through her sobriety. It took them a while to get together, and their story is like something you would see in a movie, but this one didn't get the fairytale ending.

The coronavirus quarantine added to the ups and downs of the year, but she felt a sense of peace.

"He is just my rock," she told Good Morning America exclusively. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I don't know where I would be without him.</a>" The dancer made the decision to stop drinking at her engagement party in 2018. She attributed quitting to her late father, who fought and overcame alcoholism. Burke first started drinking when she joined Dancing With The Stars and partied all the time.</p><p>Not only did Matthew Lawrence help Cheryl with her mental health during that time, but he also made sure she was eating and helped her to balance her busy schedule. He also bought her a puppy in 2020, which they named Yasbella.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Dancing With The Stars' Pairings Who Are Still Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=matthew-lawrence-was-cheryl-burke-39-s-first-non-toxic-relationship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Matthew Lawrence Was Cheryl Burke's First Non-Toxic Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Burke opened up on Instagram about her pattern of dating toxic men, but Matthew was the exception. “Looking back, I honestly think that the first relationship I ever had that did not fit this abusive pattern was when my now-husband Matt and I dated the first time around back in 2007,” she posted. "I honestly think at the time when we first dated, I didn’t clearly love myself enough to think that I deserved to be with someone who was actually nice to me. And I was just wrapped up in this new get-out-of-jail-free card, L.A.-party lifestyle, whereas he had already kind of been there and done that, since he grew up in this industry.”</p><p>Burke added that she is “so grateful and happy” the pair reconnected and that “he’s the complete opposite of everything bad about my past relationships.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cheryl-burke-and-matthew-lawrence-39-s-divorce-details><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cheryl Burke And Matthew Lawrence's Divorce Details</span></h2><p>TMZ announced that Cheryl Burke, 37, filed for divorce from Matthew Lawrence, 42, after three years of marriage. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to court documents obtained by US Weekly</a>, the DWTS pro submitted the paperwork on February 18, 2022, and the date of separation was listed at January 7, 2021.
