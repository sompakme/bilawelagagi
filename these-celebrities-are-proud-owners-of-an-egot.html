In addition, Rodgers earned a Pulitzer for his work in South Pacific, technically making him a PEGOT winner (Marvin Hamlisch is the only other person to earn five) but the two men are a rarity, among an already <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">elite group</a>.</p><p>EGOT winners hold one award from the four main award genres: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. Believe it or not, there are only 16 artists in this coveted club, many of which are composers, lyricists, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">directors </a>and producers but it takes a special person to earn the honor and few consider themselves an actor or actress.</p><p>Check out the list of celebrity actors and actresses that have earned the EGOT and their current net worth.</p><h2 id=helen-hayes-100-000>Helen Hayes – $100,000</h2><p>In 1977 the actress completed her EGOT status, earning a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album in Great American Documents. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, Hayes is considered one of the most highly regarded actresses to ever grace the stage. Her career lasted more than 80 years, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">appearing on Broadway</a> at just eight-years-old. Nicknamed “First Lady of American Theatre”, Hayes passed away in 1993.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-gielgud-1-2-million>John Gielgud – $1.2 Million</h2><p>Gielgud obtained EGOT status in 1991 with an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries, Summer’s Lease but with a career spanning eight decades, the English actor and theater director had plenty of time to achieve the feat. Gielgud didn’t begin his film career until he was in his sixties but appeared in Elizabeth alongside <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Cate Blanchett </a>and 1995’s First Knight with Sean Connery and Richard Gere. He passed away in 2000 at 96-years-old.</p><h2 id=rita-moreno-10-million>Rita Moreno – $10 Million</h2><p>The 90-year-old actress, singer and dancer received the final piece of the puzzle with an Emmy in 1977 for Outstanding Lead or Single Performance in The Muppet Show. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Moreno brought fans some of the best-known film musicals of all time</a>, including Singin’ in the Rain, The King and I and in 1962, she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in the original film version of West Side Story. Moreno was also the first Latina woman to earn a Peabody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Dick Van Dyke Wants To Be Knighted Following Lifetime Achievement Award</a></span></p><h2 id=audrey-hepburn-55-million>Audrey Hepburn – $55 Million</h2><p>The decades-long career of one of America’s favorites led Hepburn to earn an Oscar for Best Actress in Roman Holiday in 1953 and then an Emmy in 1993 for Outstanding individual achievement in informational programming in Gardens of the World With Audrey Hepburn according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>. As many fans know, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Hepburn </a>dedicated the latter part of her life toward humanitarian efforts but will always been known for classics like Breakfast at Tiffany’s and My Fair Lady. The actress was never able to enjoy her status, however, due to the final award coming in 1994, one year after she passed away from cancer, making her the first person to become an EGOT posthumously.</p><h2 id=whoopi-goldberg-60-million>Whoopi Goldberg – $60 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Younger generations may know Goldberg as one of the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">hosts on ABC’s The View</a>, however, the actress, screenwriter, comedian and producer has a successful film career to her name. She achieved EGOT status in 2002 after bringing home both an Emmy for Outstanding Class Special, Beyond Tara: The Extraordinary Life of Hattie McDaniel and a Tony for Best Musical, Thoroughly Modern Millie.

In 2001 and 2002, Brooks brought home several Tony awards and a Grammy for his work, though it must have seemed full circle for him because one of his first awards was an Oscar for the original 1967 The Producers film.</p><h2 id=john-legend-100-million>John Legend – $100 Million</h2><p>As the most recent recipient of the EGOT, and the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">first Black male artist to join the club</a>, Legend boasts a Grammy for Best New Artist in 2006 (among at least 10 others) and earned his final award to complete the collection in 2018; an Emmy for Jesus Christ Superstar, according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Life and Style Magazine</a>.
