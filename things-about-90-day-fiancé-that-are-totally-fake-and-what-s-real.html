The couples must marry before their visas expire in 90 days, or the visiting partner will have to return home.” Indeed, the premise seems shocking and almost impossible. But some couples do find love this way. Unfortunately,&nbsp;not everyone gets a happily ever after and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many of the couples do break up</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show has been on air&nbsp;since 2014 and&nbsp;it's no surprise that the couples featured on the&nbsp;series have grown somewhat of a&nbsp;fanbase.
