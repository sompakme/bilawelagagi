First, she won 'America's Most Talented Kids' in 2004. This lead her to her first record deal with Geffen Records, but unfortunately, no music was released. In 2010, she joined <a href=#>'American Idol'</a>, however was eliminated just before making it into the Top 24.</p><p>Tori focused on making her own music thereafter, frequently uploading covers to her Youtube channel which has now amassed over 2.93 million subscribers. Her first ever youtube video, 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' on the 15th of May, 2007! In the video biography, she states she was 'only 11 years old' when it was recorded. It has now reached over 290,000 views!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She first gained notable traction after her cover of 'Thinkin Bout You' by Frank Ocean went viral, surpassing well over 28,000,000 views. Soon after, she released her first EP titled 'Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly' on the 1st of May, 2012. After several rejections from producers to assist Tori in her outreach to stardom, she took it into her own hands. This EP was a solo effort, as she singlehandedly wrote, recorded, and produced the EP.</p><p>"Sometimes I ask myself, what would my album be like if I had the chance to put it out, but didn’t go through all of that pain and heartbreak I endured coming up in this business as a kid." Said Tori Kelly in a 2016 interview with Forbes Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early 2013, Tori Kelly signed with 'Capitol Records', scoring Scooter Bruan as her manager.

The EP has over 211 million streams in total, and quickly placed 16th on the US Billboard 200 after it was released.</p><h2 id=how-tori-kelly-earned-a-net-worth-of-5-million>How Tori Kelly Earned A Net Worth Of $5 Million</h2><p>Tori Kelly has been on the path to musical fame since her childhood, and it's no surprise. She came from a musical background, as her parents, Allywn and Laura Kelly both played instruments including bass, keyboards and saxophones and more. Her features as a contestant in <a href=#>multiple musical tv shows</a>, and her live performances made her some money early on her musical journey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A big source of income for Tori Kelly was the selling of her first two EPs. 'Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly' sold more than 14,000 copies. Her second EP, 'Foreworld' sold more than 16,000 copies.</p><p>Her performances with well-known musical stars surely attributed to her wealthy successes.

He proposed to her the following year, and the couple plastered wholesome wedding photos on Instagram in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tori disclosed that one of their all-time favorite dates is a trip to California's Disneyland! Despite rather pricey food stalls and an even heftier admission fee, the couple considers it a regular date that they both enjoy.</p><p>“We were literally at Disneyland the other day just walking around. We don’t even necessarily go on rides all the time. We’ll just get food just because it’s happy. It’s the happiest place on Earth.” Said Tori Kelly in a 2018 interview with Us Magazine.</p><p>Tori Kelly does not disclose information regarding what house she lives in, what car she drives nor excessively large purchases. She remains a humble celebrity who, to her core, enjoys all that is music.
