"Debbie had decided she wanted to open herself up to doing some television. When we saw the list, we took one look at her name and said, ‘Oh my god, would she really do it? And she did. We never went to anyone else," Sheri Singer, the film’s executive producer, said in an interview with E!.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Top Disney Channel Original Movies Of The Last 30 Years, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=sara-paxton><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sara Paxton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sara Paxton relaced Brown in the last movie, Return To Halloweentown.
