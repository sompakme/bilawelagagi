After all, Joey was a memorable part of many '90s movies that fans watched over and over again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adam Sandler Wisely Chose 'Big Daddy' Over This Kevin Smith Film</a></span></p><p>At the height of Joey's career, she worked with Adam on Big Daddy, a movie <a href=#>some people think deserves a sequel</a>, and she joined <a href=#>the cast of Dazed and Confused</a>. Then, Joey seemed to disappear from the spotlight seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>Now that it has been years since Joey was a mainstay of Hollywood, she has become a <a href=#>forgotten '90s star</a> for a lot of people. Despite that, it turns out that Joey has remained busy in recent years, both in Hollywood and in her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-joey-lauren-adams-39-career>What Happened To Joey Lauren Adams' Career?</h2><p>During the '90s, Joey Lauren Adams went on an incredible run in her career. A memorable part of movies like Dazed and Confused, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Big Daddy, Joey didn't become a household name but millions of people knew who she was and loved her work.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Kevin Smith's 'Mallrats' TV Show?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Joey, the truth is that her career didn't enjoy nearly as much success during the 2000s. Instead, the most notable roles Joey was a part of that decade were Dr. Dolittle 2 and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and she only had tiny roles in both of those movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joey-lauren-adams-and-dwight-ewell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If that wasn't bad enough, fans who love seeing Joey on the big screen had even less to celebrate during the 2010s. While Joey continued to work in films consistently during the first half of the 2010s, none of the movies she was a part of wound up making much of a mark on audiences.</p><p>On the bright side, however, the 2010s was the decade in which Joey really branched out in her career. After previously being best known for movies, Joey showed up in a lot of TV shows over those years.</p><p>Some of Joey's most notable TV credits from the 2010s include appearing in several episodes of United States of Tara and Switched at Birth. Joey also starred in a show called Still the King with Billy Ray Cyrus but it was canceled after two seasons.</p><p>When Joey wasn't busy embracing television acting during the 2010s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she also worked behind the camera</a>. After previously writing and directing a 2006 movie titled Come Early Morning, Joey helmed two episodes of Still the King in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joey-lauren-adams-red-carpet.jpg><p>Most recently, it seems like Joey is making some forays into acting once again. After Joey's show Still the King was canceled in 2017, she didn't appear onscreen for years aside from a cameo in the 2019 Kevin Smith movie Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.</p><p>In 2022, things seem to be picking up for Joey's acting career once again. After appearing in a movie titled Tankhouse, Joey took a recurring role in the TV show The L Word: Generation Q.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-joey-lauren-adams-single-now>Is Joey Lauren Adams Single Now?</h2><p>Even though Joey Lauren Adams never was the kind of star that the paparazzi would follow around, that doesn't mean her dating history is a mystery. Instead, it is known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey has been involved with four men over the years</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Inside Look At Harley Quinn And Kevin Smith’s Relationship</a></span></p><p>Before Kevin Smith met his current wife and they had their daughter Harley Quinn together, he and Joey Lauren Adams were a couple. Reportedly together from 1995 until 1997, the pair were a couple around the time they made Mallrats and Chasing Amy together.</p><p>Once Joey and Kevin's relationship came to an end, she then went on to date someone even more famous. In the latter half of 1997 and the first half of 1998, Joey and Vince Vaughn were together and they even made red-carpet appearances together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Joey and Vince went their separate ways, nothing is publicly known about who she dated in the following years. Then, in 2005 Joey briefly got involved with the writer and director Andrew Calder.</p><p>Finally, in 2014 Joey married a cinematographer named Brian Vilim. While very little is known about Joey and Brian's relationship except they still seem to be married, he has posted an image on Instagram that included Joey and he it captioned #family.</p><p>As for Joey's social media conduct, she seems to principally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">focus on her political views on Twitter</a>. Joey also posts about politics on Instagram, but she also posts a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pictures from throughout her career</a> that fans likely will enjoy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbOnrBmpJGqv6a6jJqbmqWjqHqir9OipaBlk5a%2FprHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-took-a-strict-rule-out-of-tom-cruise-s-playbook-regarding-her-employees.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Took A Strict Rule Out Of Tom Cruise's Playbook Regarding Her Employees</span></a>
