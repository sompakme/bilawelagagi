I can’t wait.”</p><p>One year later, the “I Love This Bar” singer was trying to stay positive and hoped to tour again.</p><p>“I’m feeling pretty good. Basically, everything is in a real positive trend. You never know with cancer, so you have to prepare,” he told The Oklahoman <a href=#>in June 2023</a>, adding his tumor had shrunk amid chemotherapy treatments. “I’ve got more wind. And I’m thinking about bringing the band in and setting up, playing two or three days somewhere just to see if I can get through two hours. All I gotta do is see if I can get through two or three nights of work and get a little break in this chemo, and we’ll go back to work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Country-Singer-Toby-Keith-s-Battle-With-Stomach-Cancer-in-His-Own-Words-It-s-Debilitating-141.jpg><p>Keith last stepped out at the <a href=#>People’s Choice Country Awards</a> to accept the Country Icon Award.</p><p>“I’ve been OK, just been rocking and rolling.
