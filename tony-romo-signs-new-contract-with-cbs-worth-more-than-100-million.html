This&nbsp;is the&nbsp;the most lucrative deal ever for a sports analyst, according to Marchand.</p><p>Pro Football Hall of Fame head coach <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Madden</a> was previously the highest-paid NFL analyst ever, earning $8 million annually.</p><p>Earlier this week, Marchand reported that ESPN was going to be CBS' "main competition" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for Romo</a>, whose three-year deal expired after the 2019 season. The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback joined the CBS broadcast booth in 2017, shortly after retiring from football.</p><p>Romo replaced Phil Simms (who was moved to The NFL Today) and was paired with Jim Nantz, the lead play-by-play voice for CBS.&nbsp;The duo called Super Bowl LII between the Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots in Atlanta. They'll&nbsp;also call Super Bowl LV in Tampa Bay next year, having switched the broadcast rotation around with NBC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriots Are Betting Favorites To Get Tom Brady Amid Departure Rumors</a></strong></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotrac.com</a>, the former Pro Bowler made just over $127.422 million in his career, which spanned from 2004 to 2016. After spending his first two seasons as a backup, Romo took over as the starter for Drew Bledsoe during the 2006 campaign.</p><p>Romo is widely regarded as one of the best sports analysts today. His humorous personality, detailed analysis and&nbsp;mastery of correctly predicting plays have made him the perfect broadcast partner for Nantz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>$17 million is obviously a lot to pay for an analyst, but CBS is paying billions annually to broadcast an NFL game. Not only that, but NFL ratings <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have increased over the last two years</a>, so CBS obviously had no issue in paying historic amounts of dollars to keep their top NFL analyst.</p><p><strong>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Date Revealed For Westworld Season 3 Along With New Trailer</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJ%2Bjxm6%2BzqamZp2Rp7u0ecyoqZ5lpJ2ur3mQaWdmpZmhuaq7zWamp2WemsRur8GsZJ2dkaF8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tina-turner-and-husband-erwin-bach-buy-a-76m-swiss-estate.html><span>←</span><span>Tina Turner And Husband Erwin Bach Buy A $76M Swiss Estate</span></a>
