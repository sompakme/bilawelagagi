Others feel as if these athletes' lofty pay-checks are justified due to the risk of injury and future complications associated with the “wear-and-tear” that comes with their job. For example, many athletes have been faced with severe, season-ending injuries that keep them out of the game for extended periods of time. This raises situations where sports stars are being paid huge amounts to "heal" as opposed to actually playing their game. In leagues where so much emphasis is placed on winning, serious injuries to key players can sometimes mean the difference between becoming champions and losing it all. Either way, injuries have become an important factor in professional sports and something that most players will have to deal with over the course of their career.&nbsp;With these factors in mind, here are ten of the highest-earning sports players to lose their season due to an injury:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-brien-taylor---1-55-million-per-year><strong>10.
