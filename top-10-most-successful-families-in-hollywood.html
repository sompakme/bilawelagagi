When it comes to celebrity families, that blood runs green. Sure, it might be easy to get famous when one, if not both of your parents are already famous. But oftentimes, celebrities' kids only make headlines and not paychecks. The following celebrity families are exceptions to this rule, with two or more members boasting multimillion dollar net worths and a list of accomplishments to back that cash up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-the-smiths>10) The Smiths</h2><p>Possibly the quintessential celebrity family, each member is famous in their own right. With a combined net worth of nearly $250 million, the Smith family success spreads across various areas of the entertainment industry, including film, television, and music. Papa <a href=#>Will's</a> earnings fluctuate from year to year, taking a bit of a break between 2008 and 2012, when the rest of his family got to shine. <a title="Jada Pinkett Smith Net Worth" href=#>Jada Pinkett</a> starred in the mildly successful TNT series, Hawthorne which lasted three seasons, as well as a speaking role in the Madagascar franchise. <a title="Jaden Smith Net Worth" href=#>Jaden</a> has had a fairly lucrative film career so far, earning around $8 million by the age of 15. Daughter <a title="Willow Smith Net Worth" href=#>Willow's</a> success comes primarily from her hit single 'Whip My Hair', as well as a few smaller acting roles in a handful of movies and TV shows. Despite Will and Jaden's 2013 flop, After Earth the Smith clan remains one of the biggest powerhouse families in entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-the-jenner-kardashians>9) The Jenner-Kardashians</h2><p>Keeping up with the Kardashians is easier said than done. Between the actual Kardashians (<a title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kim</a>, <a title="Khloe Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Khloe</a>, <a title="Kourtney Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kourtney</a>, and <a title="Robert Kardashian Jr. Net Worth" href=#>Rob</a>) and the Jenners (<a title="Kris Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Kris</a>, <a title="Bruce Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Bruce</a>, <a title="Kendall Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Kendall</a>, and <a title="Kylie Jenner Net Worth" href=#>Kylie</a>), this family raked in well over $50 million in 2013. This may be a surprising number, especially for people who can't explain exactly what they do. For starters, each member earns money per episode of their E! reality show, with the three Kardashian sisters at around $50,000. On top of that, the family has dozens of endorsement deals, as well as their name on a plethora of things, from a Sears clothing line to indoor tanning lotions. The two youngest members of the family, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, are up and comers in the fashion world, holding their own by snagging some legitimate modeling gigs. For an added bonus, factor in any of the former or current spouses or partners, which include NBA player <a title="Lamar Odom Net Worth" href=#>Lamar Odom</a> and rapper <a title="Kanye West Net Worth" href=#>Kanye West</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-the-osbournes>8) The Osbournes</h2><p>Hard to believe that The Osbournes reality show ended almost 10 years ago. The MTV series was the first glimpse into the lives of Black Sabbath frontman <a href=#>Ozzy</a>, his wife <a title="Sharon Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Sharon </a>and their two kids,&nbsp;<a title="Kelly Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Kelly</a> and <a title="Jack Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Jack</a>. Although the world knew Ozzy from his days as a rock god, the show more or less launched the careers of the rest of the family. Since the conclusion of the show, the female Osbournes' accomplishments have included Sharon's co-hosting gig on CBS',&nbsp;The Talk&nbsp;and Kelly's increasing presence on the E! Network's, Fashion Police. Jack has appeared in an array of films and reality shows since the early 2000s, but it was his third place finish on season 17 of Dancing with the Stars that earned him the most recognition since the family’s MTV days. Not to be outdone, the patriarch is still bringing home the rock 'n' roll dough, earning over $100 million in record sales as of 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-the-jolie-pitt-voights>7) The Jolie-Pitt-Voights</h2><p>Let's start with seniority in this family mashup. <a title="Angelina Jolie Net Worth" href=#>Angelina Jolie's</a> famous dad, <a title="Jon Voight Net Worth" href=#>Jon Voight</a> is one of the most successful movie actors around. His career has spanned across six decades, appearing in over 80 roles. Their off screen father-daughter relationship has been rather rocky over the years, but it hasn't stopped Jolie from hitting A-list status. With a net worth of $145 million and a career that hasn't slowed down, Jolie's upcoming film, Maleficent even features some of her and Brad Pitt's kids, in their first on-screen appearances. Speaking of <a title="Brad Pitt Net Worth" href=#>Mr. Pitt</a>, who is undoubtedly one of the biggest movie stars of all time, has recently gained success as a producer, including 2014's Oscar winner for best picture for 12 Years a Slave.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-the-jacksons>6) The Jacksons</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A list of successful celebrity families would be incomplete without this infamous clan. The most legendary family on this list, the Jacksons, have been around for the better part of the last 50 years. Starting off as kids in the music industry, in the 1960s, The Jackson 5 were followed by several separate solo music and film careers. The most successful of the living eight Jackson kids is <a title="Janet Jackson Net Worth" href=#>Janet</a>, who had a string of hits in the 80s and 90s, as well as multiple acting roles. But of course, the Jacksons would be nothing without the King of Pop himself, <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>. Arguably one of the greatest artists who has ever lived, the late MJ has a net worth of over $1 billion. This fortune will continue to grow, despite Michael's death nearly five years ago, with sustained record sales.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-the-williams>5) The Williams</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Number five on the list is a father daughter duo. Dad, <a title="Brian Williams Net Worth" href=#>Brian Williams</a>, has been the anchor of NBC, Nightly News for almost 10 years and since 2008, has steadily held the number one network news program position. Currently earning $13 million a year, Brian has become one of the most respected and well loved newsmen of his time. The Williams just recently became a successful family when daughter, Allison earned her first starring role on HBO's hipster hit, Girls. Considered to be one of the darlings of young Hollywood and an up and coming talent in the business, the Yale grad landed an endorsement deal in 2013 with Simple skincare brand.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-the-wilson-hanks>4) The Wilson-Hanks</h2><p>One look at actor, <a title="Colin Hanks Net Worth" href=#>Colin Hanks</a> and it's hard to deny the resemblance to his A-list dad. He may not be the product of Tom's over 25-year marriage with actress <a title="Rita Wilson Net Worth" href=#>Rita Wilson</a>, but they're still a family and an über famous one at that. <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> is definitely one of the biggest movie stars of all time. He's been around since the 1980s, churning out hit movie after hit movie, along with a handful of awards, including two Oscars. Still making films, both on screen and behind the camera, Tom Hanks' net worth is over $300 million. Not to be outdone, Rita Wilson has had a successful film and TV career also, appearing in 70 roles over the past five decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-the-mann-apatows>3) The Mann-Apatows</h2><p><a title="Judd Apatow Net Worth" href=#>Judd Apatow</a> is truly one of the kings of modern comedy. He was the face behind some of the most iconic and successful comedy movies and television series over the past 10+ years. He directed, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and produced dozens of other titles, including Anchorman, Superbad, Bridesmaids, Girls and more. His wife and children appear in several of his movies. 15-year-old daughter, Maude is very popular on Twitter with over 190,000 followers and wife, <a title="Leslie Mann Net Worth" href=#>Leslie Mann</a> has appeared in nearly 30 films since the 1990s.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-the-sheen-estevezes>2) The Sheen-Estevezes</h2><p>It's been a few years since the pop culture storm known as <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a>, erupted. He's stayed somewhat out of the public eye in recent years and before the days of winning and tiger blood, Charlie had a very successful TV and film career. His iconic role on CBS' smash hit, Two and a Half Men earned him a whopping $1.3 million per episode salary in 2010. Dad, <a title="Martin Sheen Net Worth" href=#>Martin</a>, has had a long run in Hollywood as well, appearing in nearly 250 roles over the past 50+ years. Let's not forget about oldest brother,&nbsp;<a href=#>Emilio Esteves</a>! Relatively quiet in recent years, Emilio was huge in the 80s and 90s as a member of the Brat Pack. He is still reportedly worth around $15 million today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-the-cyruses>1) The Cyruses</h2><p>Twenty years ago, <a title="Billy Ray Cyrus Net Worth" href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a> was the only member of this musical family that anyone really knew. His biggest hit, 'Achy Breaky Heart' reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1992, and can still be heard on country radio stations and weddings to this day. It wasn't until 2006 that the world was introduced to another member of the Cyrus clan, daughter <a href=#>Miley</a>, who starred on the Disney Channel's hit series, Hannah Montana. Miley didn't earn a lot from the show, but it undoubtedly launched her acting and music career. Since then, she has starred in nearly 20 movies and television series and has released four albums. With her recent image transformation, rarely does a week go by without some kind of news or tidbit about Miley, who is now worth $150 million. Another member of the Cyrus family worth mentioning is Miley's brother <a title="Trace Cyrus Net Worth" href=#>Trace</a>, a member of the band Metro Station. The band's hit single, 'Shake It' peaked at #4 on the Billboard Pop Songs chart in 2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF5zKiqrWWjqrCksdKsna6kXZuurrXLopysZZmjeqm7y6WwsKefmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./timoth%C3%A9e-chalamet-had-to-deal-with-three-of-his-ex-girlfriends-attending-the-met-gala.html><span>←</span><span>Timothe Chalamet Had To Deal With Three Of His Ex-Girlfriends Attending The Met Gala</span></a>
