Though they share a lot of content about their give kids, the couple also hadn’t mentioned each other online in a long time, fuelling break-up rumors.</p><p>But the celebrities proved they’re still very much a couple when they stepped out on Labor Day weekend.</p><p>Dean and Tori showed up to the A-list Malibu Chili Cook-Off event on Sunday, September 4th in casual outfits. Dean wore a matching hoodie and sweat-shorts look, while Tori was dressed in baby sweatpants and a white tank top. Though they kept their PDA on the down-low, the couple were spotted walking through the crow together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Pete Davidson Now Regrets Dating Kim K & Won’t Speak To Her</a></span></p><h2 id=they-allegedly-went-through-a-ldquo-trial-separation-rdquo-earlier-this-year>They Allegedly Went Through A “Trial Separation” Earlier This Year</h2><p>It appeared Tori and Dean had broken up in June when reports said they’d officially separated after 15 years of marriage. “[They’re] going through with a trial separation,” a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>A second source explained that the only reason they’re hesitant about starting the divorce process is because of how expensive they’ll be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They know divorce will be expensive and it’s not something they’re willing to go through right now. They both feel trapped,” the source explained. “Having kids makes it more difficult because they don’t want their children to be unhappy, yet at the same time, Tori has been unhappy for quite a while now. They truly are still together for their kids.”</p><p>Another insider also told the publication that Tori’s friends are “worried” for her amid the slip, and fear she’s falling into a depression.</p><p>Dean and Tori have been married since 2006. They originally met while married to other people. The couple has been plagued by infidelity and divorce rumors for years. In 2013, for instance, Dean publicly admitted to cheating and later sought treatment for sex addiction.</p><p>Just last November, <a href=#>E! News</a> reported that the pair’s marriage was “over,” and that Tori planned to file for divorce. But with no filing made and their most recent public appearance, it seems that Dean and Tori are still committed to their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>It’s Over?
