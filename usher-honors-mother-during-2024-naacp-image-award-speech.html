The R&B icon was recognized for his “unparalleled talent and remarkable contributions” to entertainment, as Derrick Johnson, President and CEO of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>NAACP</a>, stated ahead of the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Beyond his vocal talent and stage presence, Usher has empowered thousands of under-resourced youth to pursue their dreams through college readiness programs, financial literacy, and career planning. His dedication to creating positive change in the world has touched countless lives, redefining the boundaries of creativity and compassion,” Johnson’s statement read.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Johnson presented Raymond, 45, with the coveted award. In his acceptance speech, Usher took a trip <a href=#>down memory lane</a>. He retraced his steps in the game, recalling pivotal moments that eventually led him to greatness, highlighting his inspirations<a href=#> like New Edition</a>. Raymond also spoke to his foundational familial lifeline: his mother, <a href=#>newly wedded wife</a>, and all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m very honored to receive this amazing award; from the depths of my soul, my passion work is what has mattered to me since my mother has made me understand what the opportunity to be able to speak to the entire world is,” he began. “I wanted to make it known that far too often, women in our industry [don’t] get the recognition that they truly deserve. When we first started, it was even harder for a mother to believe in the dreams that I had because I was unwavering, being raised without a father. In our home being raised [by] a single parent…it was a lot. But [mom], if anybody deserves it more than anybody, it’s her.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The tenacity that it took to look within a male-dominated industry and believe in your son unwaveringly, no matter how hard those board rooms may have been, she didn’t have the experience…but because of that, I have this moment,” he continued. “I want you to know how much I really love, honor, recognize, and appreciate you. It’s an incredible honor to be recognized by the NAACP in and this beautiful community. We all take our crafts very serious…I am thankful for the support that my mother gave me. I’m overwhelmed by the appreciation from my entire family. I thank my beautiful mother and my beautiful <a href=#>wife, Jennifer, </a>for holding me down. I dedicate this award to family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The NAACP’s President Award has been annually awarded to esteemed Black figures since the show’s 1987 iteration. Past President Award honorees included <a href=# id=auto-tag_ella-fitzgerald data-tag=ella-fitzgerald>Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_jay-z data-tag=jay-z>Jay-Z</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_lauryn-hill data-tag=lauryn-hill>Lauryn Hill</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_lebron-james data-tag=lebron-james>LeBron James</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_spike-lee data-tag=spike-lee>Spike Lee</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_rihanna data-tag=rihanna>Rihanna</a>, and more.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier in the night, Usher spoke to <a href=# id=auto-tag_terrence-j data-tag=terrence-j>Terrence J</a> during the 55th Annual Awards Red Carpet. He coyly discussed his excitement for the ceremony and how it feels to be honored later in the evening: “To be around this incredible group of people, all these beautiful Black people, I’m really happy to be honored tonight. I’m in great company,” the singer expressed during the live BET broadcast.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6rAqbHRZp%2Bopp%2BnwG65zq2fnqpdZ31zgIynmJqboGK2rq3GnmSar5GnsW6%2Fz56cnKBdZn90gJdvaG5qZGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tori-spelling-dean-mcdermott-shake-divorce-rumors-with-rare-appearance.html><span>←</span><span>Tori Spelling &amp;amp; Dean McDermott Shake Divorce Rumors With Rare Appearance</span></a>
