The Jaguar songbird’s latest public display of appreciation was for <a href=# id=auto-tag_usher data-tag=usher>Usher</a> as she gifted him a custom Super Bowl LVIII leather jacket during his concert on Wednesday night (Nov. 29). The “U Remind Me” artist is slated to<a href=#> grace the halftime show stage </a>in 2024.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Monét took the spotlight and began by reminding the crowd of <a href=#>Usher’s irreplaceable legacy</a>. “We got one of the last living icons in the building with us right now. We just want to congratulate you; we want to celebrate you. You see the culture in the building. Make some noise for Usher, y’all,” she said while the crowd erupted with cheers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“As a small token of my appreciation, I wanted to give you this gift,” the “Smoke” artist continued, as she unveiled the one-of-one jacket. The black leather garment was complete with “SUPERBOWL LVIII” stitched on the back in big white letters to match the bedazzled “USHER” design on the front. The two then embraced and Victoria’s “On My Mama” began blaring through the speakers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Usher made sure to return the gratitude, shouting her out while on stage and providing words of encouragement to her flourishing career. “The fact that you look as beautiful as you do tonight and you blessed me with this gift. Once again, Victoria Monet ladies and gentlemen, what an amazing time to be able to share this moment with you tonight. I celebrate you, babygirl. Continue to grow, continue to be great. Success looks good on you. Keep going,” he said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another trailblazer who has recently shown love to the <a href=#>34-year-old mom of one</a> is the iconic<a href=#> Janet Jackson, </a>an extra special cosign as Victoria has named Jackson as her “role model.” The industry veteran attended the the&nbsp;<a href=#>penultimate show</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Jaguar Tour</a>&nbsp;in London, where they exchanged a moment backstage.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jackson wrote afterwards on Instagram, “Victoria, I’m so happy for you! Congratulations on all your success. May God continue to bless you and hold you close. [Love] J.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Party Girls” songstress commemorated the personal milestone with her own touching caption, writing, “There is no me as an artist without Janet Jackson, so it feels like you and your music have held my hand the whole time… You are my idol, my legend and a huge part of my future legacy as a strong root of it all. The inspiration you’ve gifted is oceans deep and generations long.” Revisit the moment below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6u2pMDOq6CaZZ2ku6bAjKCgn6yjYsK0tMSrZJyto6m8rnnSrqeeql2XvLi4jKWtoqGZYreir8qeq2ZpYmiBeX6TbGtxZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./t-pain-named-twitch-s-first-ever-music-ambassador.html><span>←</span><span>T-Pain Named Twitch's First-Ever Music Ambassador</span></a>
