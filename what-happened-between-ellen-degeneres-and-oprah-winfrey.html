DeGeneres made history when she made her character come out as gay at the same time. It was the first time a lead character in a sitcom was openly gay.</p><p>Winfrey and DeGeneres' connection did not fade away. Throughout the years, Winfrey has made many appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The two have shared a friendship that audiences have watched play out on television.</p><h2 id=oprah-received-backlash-when-she-played-ellen-39-s-therapist-in-her-coming-out-episode>Oprah Received Backlash When She Played Ellen's Therapist In Her Coming Out Episode</h2><p>Winfrey played Ellen's therapist in the two-part coming out episode of the sitcom Ellen.

However, there was a lot of backlash that followed. This is something Winfrey said she didn't see coming.</p><p>"I misread that everybody was like us, that they were open-minded and that they were receptive and that they wanted people to just be who they are," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winfrey said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar53570833.jpg><p>Winfrey then told DeGeneres just how bad the response was.</p><p>"It was so bad. The next day after the show, I flew back to Chicago and the next day … we had to put another person on the switchboard. I remember something like 900-and-something calls; they couldn’t keep up," she remembered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There was a lot of, ‘Go back to Africas,'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winfrey continued</a>.

DeGeneres even revealed there was a bomb threat on the set, which scared her. Then, Winfrey gave DeGeneres some words of encouragement.</p><p>"You would not be who you are … you wouldn’t be able to open hearts and touch hearts and change peoples’ minds and make a difference in the world had you not had the courage to do that," Winfrey told DeGeneres. "And 20 years ago, you had no idea it would put you in this seat."</p><h2 id=ellen-started-a-campaign-on-her-talk-show-to-land-the-cover-of-o-magazine>Ellen Started A Campaign On Her Talk Show To Land The Cover Of O Magazine</h2><p>There was a lot of debate about whether DeGeneres made the right decision about coming out. DeGeneres, however, maintained that she didn't regret her coming out, because of the mail she received from fans who told her she saved their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the next several years, DeGeneres appeared in films like EDtv and If These Walls Could Talk 2. There was another sitcom, The Ellen Show, which was short-lived, ending after just 13 episodes, with five being unaired. DeGeneres went back to her roots in 2000 when she performed a stand-up special for HBO titled The Beginning. DeGeneres went on a stand-up tour in 2002, which led to another HBO special, Here and Now.</p><p>DeGeneres also appeared in the film Finding Nemo as Dory, which was warmly received. This was around the same time DeGeneres announced that she would be starting her own daytime talk show. In September 2003, the first episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show aired. It was a huge success and became a staple in people's homes for 19 seasons. DeGeneres interviewed celebrities, played games with the audience, and helped those in need.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was during her talk show that DeGeneres launched a campaign to appear on the cover of Winfrey's O Magazine. The campaign eventually worked, with DeGeneres being only the second person to appear alongside Winfrey on the cover. The first was Michelle Obama.</p><p>Winfrey invited DeGeneres to appear on the cover via a video call during The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2009.</p><p>"I can’t believe you’re serious about this.

"I just was really applauding your team for making this show what it's been for 19 years. Obviously, you're the face out front, but it's everybody back there that actually makes it work.
