Well, it kind of depends. She is, after all, "Queen Bey", the closest thing to royalty you get in the United States.

He comes off as the good guy (most of the time).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's put it this way:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Interview shy Beyoncé</a> does it her way, or else. Occasionally fans meet her and say how gracious she is. More often than not people who encounter her say she is over-entitled, arrogant, rude, and demanding.</p><p>For the most part, she behaves, well, like the queen of something. Don't count on her showing up on time. And rest assured she'll have her own staff, including a photographer, in tow. She is the one in charge and don't you forget it.</p><p>That's just the way it is. Beyoncé is Beyoncé. Let's take a look at what others say about their encounters with Queen Bey. Most haven't come away singing her praises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-life-is-a-self-centered-nightmare>Her Life Is A Self-Centered Nightmare</h2><p>Not our words, but the reaction of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;The Atlantic&nbsp;magazine to Beyoncé's documentary </a>about her life,&nbsp;Life Is But a Dream.&nbsp;Their conclusion? She presents a perfect facade to the world, no&nbsp;"blemishes, no snot, no bed head." The magazine points to an example of some pictures of Beyoncé performing at the Superbowl one year that had been taken by a Getty photographer. The narrative that went along with the snaps described her as "fierce." And she looked it. No, no, no said Beyoncé. She didn't like the pictures and demanded that Getty take down the pictures. And guess what? They did. What Beyoncé wants she gets.</p><p>What we see of Queen Bey is filtered and carefully managed. As the magazine said, "watching her go through hard times without a hair out of place just makes you feel bad about yourself". So true. Most media outlets thought the supposedly "real" documentary was bland, egotistical, and delusional. It's no surprise that reportedly Queen Bey has a hard time getting and keeping friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> What Happened To Gwyneth Paltrow And Beyoncé's Friendship?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-banned-from-the-pyramids>She Was Banned From The Pyramids</h2><p>So Beyoncé was in Egypt and demanded to be taken on a tour of the Pyramids. She got the top dog, Dr. Zahi Hawass, former head of antiquities, as her tour guide. He came away from his encounter saying he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sickened by her "rudeness".</a></p><p>He protested: "She said she would come at 3 pm but she came late. I said 'You have to say I'm sorry I'm late'. But she didn't open her mouth."</p>He went on: "I brought a photographer and she also had a photographer and a guard. When my photographer started to shoot, he said 'No, Stop! I am the one who says yes or no, not you.' I said 'In that case since you almost hit my photographer and you are not polite - out! I am not giving you the privilege of having you on my tour.' I said Beyoncé was stupid and I left." Did we mention that Dr. Hawass, like Beyoncé, has an out-of-control ego?That was that. She was banned from the Pyramids by Dr. Hawass, sometimes referred to as the Indiana Jones of Egypt. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2>What People Who Work For Her Have To Say</h2>One person who worked for her on a few of her concert tours tells tales of her being "terrible" to her backup dancers during rehearsals. Bey reportedly was not satisfied with the dancers. The staffer said: "She was yelling profanities while on a live mic at her back up dancers and then stormed off the stage like a child".And the guy who was building the stage got so fed up with her rudeness that he joked he was going to build it to collapse. Don't worry. It didn't.<h2>Rude To Servers</h2>There are several tales of Beyoncé's behavior towards servers in restaurants. Once, when she was out with her sister Solange, one server praised Solange for being polite and, well, nice, while Queen Bey was rude and demanding. She was, says the server, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"incredibly rude"</a> . She went on: "I get you are famous, but a true queen has class. So, in my opinion, 'Queen Bey' or whatever she is called, can kiss my you-know-what." <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Is It Hard For Solange To Live In Beyoncé's Shadow?</a></span> Well, that's quite direct and to the point, we think.And what about her husband Jay-Z? Well, the famous and filthy rich rapper is reported the good cop to Bey's bad cop. He is apparently (relatively) unassuming and polite. And don't forget that Beyoncé's family once looked down on the rapper as unsuitable for Queen Bey. She was brought up to be self-important and self-centered. <span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z Treats Wife Beyoncé To A Luxury Dinner In Italy In New Pictures</a></span> No, Beyoncé is the queen of all she surveys. And if you accept that premise then, as her fans the "BeyHive" say everything she does is just fine. There are so many people who would totally not agree and say that she can be arrogant and rude. And many say that is just totally unacceptable.Don't expect her to change any time soon. <span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Solange Get Along With Beyoncé's Husband Jay-Z After Their Infamous 'Met Gala Altercation'?</a></span> &nbsp; <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecGesKimk5p6s7HApaOyZZyeuKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-10-most-successful-families-in-hollywood.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 Most Successful Families In Hollywood</span></a>
