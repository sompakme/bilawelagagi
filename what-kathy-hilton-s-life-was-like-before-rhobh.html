However, unlike her sisters, Kathy did not harbor an interest in stardom.</p><p>Kathy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented on her brief stint in acting</a> in an interview with Bustle saying, “I didn’t really like [acting] that much. I wanted to do my own thing, like go out and have fun and have sleepovers and not have to worry about ‘Oh you can’t get a suntan over the weekend because it won’t match up [on screen].’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kathy-hilton-married-into-tremendous-wealth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kathy Hilton Married Into Tremendous Wealth</span></h2><p>Kathy Hilton is married to Rick Hilton, grandson to Hilton Hotels founder, Conrad Hilton.
