That left two players unpicked which led to the cruelest twist that the show’s producers ever came up with. Instead of getting to pick their tribe or something like that, the two unchosen players were instantly eliminated from the game and never seen again. Those two players had to make arrangements to leave their regular lives behind, with some players revealing that they even quit their jobs, to play the game.

After all that, they were eliminated based on nothing but a first impression because the show’s producers thought that would make for good TV. That was cruel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-17t095344-295.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaqVlrFww8eaq2avkah6tbTEZpqrrZWhsrTAjK2uoqukYsGprdNmqq6qpp7DsL7SZqerp5SqsKa%2B0macr52iYravr8uum56cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-re-staying-fit-for-the-holidays-with-these-idealboost-drinks.html><span>←</span><span>Were Staying Fit for the Holidays With These IdealBoost Drinks</span></a>
