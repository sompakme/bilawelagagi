By this time, fans were hooked more than ever — you can tell by the many Instagram fan accounts dedicated to the entire show and cast. So when Mädchen Amick, 50, starred as Alice Cooper (A.K.A. MILF to fans) on <a href=#>the teen drama Riverdale</a>, people began to wonder about her Twin Peaks co-star, Sherilyn Fenn, 56.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fenn earned Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for her role as Audrey Horne in the cult classic. After the end of the series, she decided to expand her range. She chose independent films over big-budget projects to avoid being typecast as "a pretty ornament" and "do deeper work." She even refused to take offers of an Audrey Horne spinoff show. As a result, she's been out of the limelight in the last years unlike her co-stars, Amick and Kyle MacLachlan, 62. Here's what she's been up to these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What 'Twin Peaks' Star Lara Flynn Boyle Looks Like Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=post--39-twin-peaks-39-career>Post-'Twin Peaks' Career</h2><p>Twin Peaks instantly made Fenn famous. She was one of People's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World, named one of Us Magazine's 10 Most Beautiful Women in the World, and was also one of FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World. Clearly, the actress received great recognition for her looks. But it made it difficult for her to break into more serious roles. "I was disillusioned with acting after the pilot of Twin Peaks," she confessed to The Philadelphia Inquirer TV Week. "I'd been doing low-budget films. I didn't want to walk through movies being a pretty ornament. At 25 I didn't know if I had it. I questioned if there was depth, if there was integrity to me. I was longing to go inside, to do deeper work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with the Australian magazine, Movie, Fenn opened up about avoiding the celebrity part of her career. "I try to keep myself centered," she said. "I don't go to parties and all that. I don't think being seen or being in the right place is going to make me a better actress. I care about my work and try to do what's right in my heart." She also told Sky Magazine that she never wanted to get in the Hollywood race expected of promising actresses like her. "The world has certain rules – Hollywood has certain rules – but it doesn't mean you have to play by them, and I don't, or I'd be a miserable person," said Fenn.</p><p>After Twin Peaks, she had a non-negotiable no-nudity clause in her contracts that kept her away from the sexy roles studios wanted her to play. Though she didn't score any roles of a lifetime ever since, she still made a mark in Gary Sinise's 1992 film adaptation of Of Mice and Men. Sinise said himself that "Sherilyn's one of the reasons we got such a great ovation at Cannes [Film Festival]." Fenn played a lonely country wife, far from the seductress roles offered to her at that time. She continues to play small parts on TV and low-budget films these days. According to IMDb, she's starring in two indie films set to come out in 2022, Losing Addison and Silent Life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe This '90s Sitcom Star Made The Top 10 List Of Highest-Paid TV Actors</a></span></p><h2 id=living-with-her-sons>Living With Her Sons</h2><p>In 1993, Fenn and musician Toulouse Holliday welcomed their first son, Myles Holliday, 27. The couple married a year later but divorced in 1997. The actress didn't remarry but has been with her boyfriend Dylan Stewart, 48, since 2006. They welcomed a son in 2007 named Christian, 14. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Daily Telegraph</a> in 2017, the actress opened up about Christian's autism. "It was hard to take him slowly out into the world," she said of dealing with her son's diagnosis which inspired her to write No Man’s Land, a children’s book about a boy with autism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Actors Who Regretted Being On 90s Sitcoms (& 5 Who Adored It)</a></span></p><p>"We received a lot of judgment," she continued. "He was very much 'my way or the highway', and would have huge fits. But to think [all children] see and learn things the same way is a huge mistake. So there was a lot to learn, and a lot to continue to learn, just to keep him growing and protected." Fenn also revealed that she was living with both of her sons. "We’re all living together again, so I get to spoil them each separately," she said of the arrangement.</p><p>The actress is obviously happy with her simple life away from the prying eyes of Hollywood. She's also been practicing Transcendental Meditation since 2014. Nowadays, she posts positive and motivational quotes for her 58.1K followers on her unverified Instagram account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Does Jonathan Taylor Thomas's Net Worth Compare To Other Teen Stars Of The 90s?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirsKGeYr2mrcqsZKyglae2rcXNZp2epp5ixKmx0Z5kmqqVYsGpsdhmpaivXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-cameron-on-going-home-reunion-with-complete-pro-hannah-brown.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler Cameron on Going Home Reunion With 'Complete Pro' Hannah Brown</span></a>
