He was successful at finding a connection with not only one but two contestants, <strong>Micah Lussier</strong> and <strong>Chelsea Griffin</strong>.</p><p>Things between Kwame and Micah, 27, seemed to be progressing well until she turned him down in favor of <a href=#>fellow contestant</a> <strong>Paul Peden</strong>, whom <a href=#>she left the pods engaged to</a>. Following her rejection, the sales development manager put all his effort into his relationship with Chelsea, 31. Not to mention, he charmed her with his guitar skills.</p><p>His hard work paid off, as he <a href=#>got down on one knee</a> in the season’s third episode. “I’m just so excited to wake up next to you every single day and not worry about how we can be perfect but always think about how incredibly real we can be,” Kwame said during his proposal to Chelsea. “That’s the life I want. That’s the perfect life for me. And so, as you stand on the other side of this wall, I wanted to ask you if you would be willing to marry me?” Much to his delight, she accepted.</p><p>“It’s hard putting it all together and realizing, like, this human being was on the other side of this wall, so it was such a surreal moment,” Kwame told <a href=#>Extra TV</a> in March 2023 of seeing Chelsea for the first time. “But, you know, obviously, I was glad with what was on the other side of the wall, so it worked out.”</p><p>Like many <a href=#>Love Is Blind couples</a>, the newly-engaged couple’s romance began to take a turn for the worse upon the cast’s trip to Mexico. After meeting Micah face-to-face for the first time, it was clear the former flames still had feelings for each other. However, Kwame didn’t take kindly to Micah joking about his “failed proposal” to her. They spent the majority of the day talking through it all. Though their lengthy interaction upset Chelsea, she and Kwame ended episode 5 in a good place.</p><p>“It was interesting seeing Micah, for sure, 100 percent,” Kwame told Extra TV. “But I think at that point in time, I was already at the point where I knew that I had made the right decision. It’s always going to be interesting taking all of the emotion that was and then applying it to the person that is. So when that happens, there is kind of a jolt, so there’s gonna be a bit of a jolt, I think, to the mind. And that did happen, and it made me think, like, ‘Who, this is really interesting. It’s actually happening. <a href=#>I’m seeing this person</a>, and I definitely had strong feelings for this person.’”</p><p>He continued: “But all in all, like, putting me and Chelsea into the same space, I knew that the energy was different and I knew that it was the right energy, you know. And so, I was, like, beyond pleased with the way that things worked out there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the couple’s future looks bright, the show’s “coming up” trailer at the end of episode 5 teased several road blocks headed the pair’s way. “I’m not sacrificing what I want, but I am compromising,” Kwame tells his fiancée in the preview. In another moment, the photographer cryptically asks Micah whether she made the right decision in turning him down, to which she responds, “Do you <a href=#>feel like you’re questioning</a>?”</p><p>Scroll below to get to know the Love Is Blind contestant:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKm7jKKqZqSfq7JutdJmmaWhnpl6tLHArKanZWSoeqzDwKacZpmgpbaitIxuZK2gmaO0tHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnqvsdOfo6KwXaeyorjIrbBmq6SWv3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-shem-bowman-involved-in-a-car-accident-wrestling-champion-from-holbrook-death-and-twitter-tribu.html><span>←</span><span>Was Shem Bowman Involved In A Car Accident?
