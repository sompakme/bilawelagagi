From the silly pranks between Jim and Dwight, to the sweeping <a href=#>romance between Pam and Jim </a>to Michael's bizarre office bonding schemes and team meetings, the workers of Dunder Mifflin feel like family to me. After a long day at work, nothing is better than watching Kevin spill a huge pot of chili.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although there is no news of Steve Carell's Michael Scott returning to the upcoming reboot, it's hard to imagine returning to the universe without the vapidly awkward boss of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. I can't imagine a new show existing in the same world as The Office without fan favorites appearing with their usual brand of chaos.</p><p>To bring Michael Scott back to a remake of The Office would mean undergoing that tear-jerking ending and possibly splitting him up from the love of his life, <strong>something I don't want to see but feels necessary to the show.</strong></p><p>This article takes a look at what a reboot to The Office will mean for Michael Scott's emotional exit and why I feel bringing Steve Carell into the reboot is the only way it would work.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-michael-scott>What Happened To Michael Scott?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/michael-scott-in-the-office.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After seven years as Dunder Mifflin Scranton's Regional Manager, Michael Scott left for Colorado. After years of failed love affairs and whatever he had going on with Jan, he met Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) and popped the question to her during Season 7's "Garage Sale". The course of true love never runs smoothly because Holly has to move to Boulder, Colorado to take care of her aging parents.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael's final episodes of The Office</a> are heartbreaking to watch</strong> as someone who had become fond of his shenanigans. Although the decision is not easy, he decides to follow the love of his life and leave his Dunder Mifflin family to follow Holly to Colorado. I had spent years rooting for Michael to finally meet the right person.</p><p>Despite his flaws and his ability to always say the wrong thing, he was a good person who deserved better than the show had given him. While I was happy to see <a href=#>Michael leave the show on happy terms</a>, <strong>The Office was never the same after his departure. </strong>Not even the charming Idris Elba could save the last two seasons of the workplace sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Scott's exit sees him saying his goodbyes to his coworkers. The most emotional moment of the entire nine seasons for me is when Pam finds Michael at the airport, hugs her former manager, and hands him a goodbye message. The scene is made even more emotional when Jenna Fischer, who played Pam, revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the note was a personal message from her to Carrell.</a></p><p>“That was me talking to Steve. I told him all the ways I was going to miss him when he left our show. Those were real tears and a real goodbye. That was a really emotional scene."</p><h2 id=why-a-reboot-of-the-office-has-to-underdo-michael-scott-39-s-ending>Why A Reboot of The Office Has To Underdo Michael Scott's Ending</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Office-Michael-Scott-Finale-Wedding.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If any reboot of The Office decides to continue Dunder Mifflin's story without acknowledging Michael Scott, it would essentially be a continuation of The Office season 8 and 9. These seasons really suffer from Steve Carell's departure, with <strong>none of his replacements ever really replacing the void left by the incomparable Michael Scott.</strong> I, like most fans of the sitcom, struggled to get through those final two series.</p><p>Having Steve Carell return, even for a small role, will be an instant appeal to fans like me. Carell's Michael Scott is a surefire to make the reboot a success. We've seen how the world of Dunder Mifflin feels flat without his presence.<strong> I can't imagine watching another series of characters trying to fill Steve Carell's huge on-screen presence.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are some options for undoing Michael Scott's farewell without ruining his character development. You could bring him back for an episode or two to reunite with his old co-workers, perhaps to celebrate a wedding or funeral. It would be easy to bring Michael Scott back full-time, with him and Holly deciding to move back to Scranton to raise their family.</p><h2 id=is-there-going-to-be-a-remake-of-the-office>Is There Going To Be A Remake Of The Office?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-office-cast.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A reboot of The Office is in the works</a>. Greg Daniels and Michael Koman are reportedly co-creating the series; Daniels wrote for the original American sitcom before moving over to Parks and Recreation, while Koman is best known for co-creating, writing and producing Nathan for You.</p><p>Instead of remaking The Office and recasting all the much-loved characters from the original NBC run, <strong>the show will cover new ground at a different office in the same universe.</strong> It has not yet been revealed if it will still focus on a paper company or move to a different type of office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sabrina Impacciatore and Domhnall Gleeson will be part of what is promised to be a large ensemble comedy. We'll have to wait and see if any familiar faces will appear in this new office setting and how this cast will connect to the existing world of Dunder Mifflin.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mindy-kaling-was-determined-to-get-steve-carell-to-stop-being-such-a-nice-person-in-real-life-during-an-exhaustive-challenge-on-the-set-of-the-office.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mindy Kaling Was Determined To Get Steve Carell To Stop Being Such A Nice Person In Real Life During An Exhaustive Challenge On The Set Of The Office">Mindy Kaling Was Determined To Get Steve Carell To Stop Being Such A Nice Person In Real Life During An Exhaustive Challenge On The Set Of The Office</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mindy Kaling did everything she could to try and make Steve Carell be a little bit mean during the filming of The Office.</p><h2 id=will-steve-carrell-return-to-the-office-remake>Will Steve Carrell Return To The Office Remake?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/michael-scott-the-office.jpg><p>According to recent reports,<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Carrell will not reprise his role as Michael Scott</a> in the reboot of The Office.</strong> He appeared for seven seasons before quitting the workplace sitcom in 2011.</p><p>"Steve and his wife, Nancy, who is also one of the architects of his career, are the type of people who never like to stay at a party too long," a source told the National Enquirer.</p><p>"That's one reason revisiting his biggest TV hit is not in the cards for them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Greg Daniels, the original show's creator, returning does put Carell in a difficult position when it comes to playing Michael Scott once more. "Steve is in a tricky place because some of his colleagues from the show, most notably [Greg], are involved in the planned reboot and would love for him to help out somehow," the insider explained.</p><p>The source even specified that the Foxcatcher star may still be involved in the show, even if Michael Scott does not return. "Even if that means writing and directing rather than appearing on camera,” they added.</p><p>The show has previously acknowledged how important Steve Carell's Michael Scott is to the world of The Office. The Oscar-nominated actor appeared in the very last episode of the sitcom, and the show's creators admitted there was no doubt he had to be included in the finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well, there wasn’t any discussion about it. It was just like, obviously, it would be great to have him and not great to make a big deal out of it because [the finale] wasn’t going to be about his character because he hadn’t been there [since the seventh season]. It wouldn’t have been a big finale without him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimn56ZmLJuvsSmmKSdXayuta%2FHZqynnJmZeq61wqGYnqRdqLCwwNOsZKKbn6O2pHnSnqWdp5abfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suge-knight-responds-to-snoop-dogg-labels-him-a-fake-crip.html><span>←</span><span>Suge Knight Responds To Snoop Dogg, Labels Him A Fake Crip</span></a>
