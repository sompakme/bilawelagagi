Actually, he attended the concert four times. Questlove Alan Leeds recalled this tidbit during VIBE’s&nbsp;2010<a href=#> Oral History of Michael Jackson&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Prince</a>.&nbsp;Leeds,&nbsp;who was&nbsp;Prince’s friend and tour manager, detailed the&nbsp;Rainbow Children&nbsp;artist attending one of The Jackson’s concerts for research purposes.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Before we set out on the&nbsp;Purple Rain&nbsp;tour, it was a case of Prince wanting to see what Michael and the Jacksons were doing in terms of production, lighting, staging&nbsp;and&nbsp;everything with the&nbsp;Victory&nbsp;tour,”&nbsp;Leeds said. “We flew to Dallas to the old stadium where the Cowboys played. There was a feeling in our camp that while what [The Jacksons] were doing was&nbsp;a very solid&nbsp;stadium production, there was nothing&nbsp;really&nbsp;cutting edge about the technology.&nbsp;The Varilites,&nbsp;which was&nbsp;a brand name for&nbsp;a type of&nbsp;computerized lighting, was the gold standard in the industry at that time.&nbsp;And we made sure we had all that sh*t. But&nbsp;The <a href=#>Jackson’s&nbsp;production </a>didn’t. Prince had a lot of respect for Michael, but he was mildly impressed with the show.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Michael attended many of the&nbsp;Purple Rain&nbsp;concerts. I have the four&nbsp;Purple Rain&nbsp;shows&nbsp;that were&nbsp;in Los Angeles in ’84.&nbsp;And now&nbsp;that I realize that Mike&nbsp;was&nbsp;in the audience, I often watch it to see if I can spot him [laughs].&nbsp;But it makes you think. Why was Mike there four nights in a row? You have already created&nbsp;Thriller, you’ve done the Moonwalk, you’ve done the groundbreaking videos&nbsp;and&nbsp;you’ve sold a million a week,” Quest pondered at the time. “You are officially in the Guinness Book of World Records.&nbsp;For all intents and purposes,&nbsp;Purple Rain&nbsp;sold 15 million units, but it was hardly the 33 million that&nbsp;Thriller&nbsp;went on to sell. So why are you this curious&nbsp;to&nbsp;who is behind you?&nbsp;Then&nbsp;I&nbsp;realized that you can’t be that successful without being competitive. Michael knew Prince was a serious threat.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y2rbiMomSapV2itqS0wJ6jZqKRmLi0u81mmpqknKh6sb7Ip5qeZZ2arq%2B1xGZoa2tkbYRzhJhvZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-dana-plato-find-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Dana Plato?
