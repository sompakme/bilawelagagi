Triple H said the rematch has been signed, and it will be Batista-Triple H II and it will be at Backlash. Triple H said Batista was on fire at WrestleMania, he was awesome. Triple H said he has watched the tape over and over, and he will find a weakness one way or another, and he has. Triple H said it was in his eyes, his eyes showed fear, his eyes told him the real story, it is the one thing that will make him an eleven time World Champion, it is the one thing Batista fears, it is the Pedigree. Triple H said that the Pedigree is the one move, that when he hits it, the whole thing will be done. Triple H said the Pedigree is the truth, and the truth is Batista made the biggest mistake of his life when he decided to screw with him. The music of the Hurricane then hit in the arena as he made his way out to the stage. Hurricane said that Triple H claims to be the best, but holy ass kicking’s, the last time we saw him in action, he was wearing a mask, not a superhero mask, but a crimson one. Triple H called Hurricane a green tomato, and Hurricane then mocked him. Hurricane said he was left laying by Triple H, and then he did the same the following week to Rosey. Hurricane said it was clobbering time, and Triple H told him to bring it. Hurricane then called Rosey down with him. Rosey and the Hurricane bother hammered away at Triple H in the corner and stomped away at him. Hurricane hit a leg lariat and Rosey squashed him in the corner and then they clotheslined him to the outside! Triple H grabbed the mic and said they picked the wrong night and the wrong guy.

Eric said no partner, no match.</p><p><b>In the arena:</b></p><p>The music of Chris Jericho hit in the arena and it is time for the Highlight Reel. Jericho welcomed us to the show and said that he has to admit that he was happy how the Money in the Bank Ladder Match turned out, but there was only one problem, and that is that he didn’t win. Jericho said he has been a bit off track, and he can trace it down to one date, October 19th 2004, the date he lost the Intercontinental Title at Taboo Tuesday. Jericho said Shelton Benjamin has done a great job, but there is something he needs to tell him face to face. Jericho then introduced Benjamin as his guest. Jericho said he wants to get straight to the point; he wants redemption. He said all his problems started when he lost that title, and he wants it back. Benjamin played a violin with his finger, and said it is playing just for him. Benjamin said he is the best pure athlete in the WWE and there is a reason he has held the title for six months. Jericho said they must start making his Hall of Fame plaque as they speak. Jericho said he didn’t give a damn about his title reign, he has been the IC Champion seven times, and that is a record. He has done it all with the Intercontinental Title and the only reason he still has it is that Jericho hasn’t made it his business to take it back until now. Benjamin told Jericho that he can do things in this ring that no one else can do and then smiled. Jericho told Benjamin to take the title and shove it up his ass. Benjamin said he could take his fist and get more hits than a Fozzy album. Jericho said there latest single is called Shelton Benjamin is a little bitch. Benjamin showed Jericho and then the two went at it throwing punches at each other. The two brawled to the floor with both men hammering away at each other. The referee’s came down to break these two men up, and Jericho wants his IC Title back!</p><p><b>Backstage:</b></p><p>Kane is shown backstage looking for Trish, and then comes across Lita. She asked him if he did it, and he said yeah, Trish is scared to death. Lita then said they are just getting started and then they french kissed passionately.</p><p><b>In the arena:</b></p><p>The music of Shawn Michaels hit in the arena and he came out to the stage. He said he has been told that if he wants to face Hassan and Daivari at Backlash, he would have to pick a partner. He said he hasn’t had much time to think about it, but the first thing that comes to his mind is how much he loves this country. He said he understands why his father and brother and nephew served their country in wars. Michaels said he is going to pick someone who feels as passionately about this as he does. Michaels said he knows that person is watching at home, and he is here on his knees asking for one favour. He isn’t asking anything more than what every other WWE fan has asked you for. They asked at the WWE Hall of Fame banquet, and he is coming out here tonight and asking him. Shawn Michaels said if he has to pick a partner, he wants that tag team partner to be HULK HOGAN! The fans went nuts and Michaels smiled as they went into a rabid Hogan chant.
