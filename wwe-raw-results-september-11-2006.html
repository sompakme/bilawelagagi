The United States Marine Core is then announced onto the stage by Howard Finkel, and then he introduced Lilian Garcia to sing America The Beautiful. Video clips are shown of the WWE Superstars in the Middle East, as well as the service men and women in attendance here at Madison Square Garden tonight. We then break out into a âUSAâ chant as Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler welcome us to RAW from the worldâs most famous arena.</p><p>Referee: Jack Doan<br>Ric Flair vs. Umaga</p><p>The music of Ric Flair hit as he made his way to the ring set for action, here on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy. Umaga then made his way to the ring led by Armando Alejandro Estrada, and we are set to go.</p><p>The match:</p><p>Flair attacked Umaga with chops as he entered the ring, but Umaga threw him off. Flair nailed a chop block and then some more chops. Umaga grabbed Flair by the throat and went for the Samoan Spike but Flair nailed a low blow as the referee was distracted with Estrada. Flair nailed more low blows and then Umaga tossed him aside to the outside of the ring. Flair has a chair and nailed Umaga in the head with it, and it had no effect on Umaga.</p><p>Winner by disqualification, Umaga</p><p>The Aftermath:</p><p>Flair went to the outside for the ring steps but Umaga knocked them out of his hands. Umaga nailed a throat thrust and then hit a Samoan Drop on the outside of the ring, and Flair is down. Umaga then got Flair back into the ring and then tossed the ring steps in as well.

Kane grabbed Umaga by the throat but Umaga countered into a belly to belly suplex. Umaga cracked Kane in the back with the chair, and then in the head. Estrada is n the apron and went to snap the cigar, but Kane sat up and went to work on Umaga, cracking him in the head repeatedly with the chair. Umaga was sent to the outside of the ring. Kane then grabbed the ring steps and tossed them right at the head of Umaga on the outside. Kane followed out and used the steps as a battering ram, sending Umaga into the crowd. Kane got back into the ring and then set off his pyro, and seems to have Umagaâs number going into Unforgiven.</p><p>Backstage:</p><p>The McMahonâs are shown entering Madison Square Gardenâs Walk of Fame. Vince said you have to be special to be in this walk, like Muhammad Ali, Walt Frazier, Carl Lewis, Larry Birdâ¦but the biggest name of them all happens to be right over there. We get there and itâs Vince McMahonâs name in the Walk of Fame. Vince said no body ever steps there, no one steps on him, but he has a feeling that tonight they will be walking all over DX.</p><p>Hell in a Cell:</p><p>We see Triple H backdropping Cactus Jack through the Hell in a Cell from No Way Out in February 2000.</p><p>In the arena:</p><p>The NYPD Pipe and Drum band make their way to ringside, playing their instruments, and the Highlanders and the one and only Rowdy Roddy Piper mad their way down to the ring! Piper got on the mic and said to give the NYPD band a round of applause. The fans chanted âRoddyâ towards the WWE Hall of Famer. Roddy said he is happy to be back in New York City. He was skirting down 8th street and saw a magazine rack. The magazine said the 51 worst offenders in WWE, and who do you think number one is? Roddy Piper! Piper said speaking of number one, he has to say he is proud to be here with the Highlanders, who are now the number one tag team contenders. Roddy asks which they are, and heâs Robbie, and heâs Roddy! Rory slapped Robbie because he gets a bit excited, but donât worry because he likes it. Roddy then slapped Robbie and then Rory and they slapped him back and Roddy said he hadnât had this much fun since he beat Mr. T. The music of the Spirit Squad then hit and they made their way to the stage. Nicky said it doesnât matter if you call those things around their waists kilts or skirts, the simple fact is that Roddy Piper and the Highlanders, and even the NYPD Bandâ¦they are all dressed like a bunch of girls. Roddy said thatâs some pretty tough words from a bunch of guys who had their testicles removed and replaced them with pompoms! Piper said itâs a long time since he had a fight in MSG, so letâs have us a six man tag right now! The Spirit Squad went into a group hug to discuss, and they said heâs on. Piper sent the pipe and drum band to the back, and the Squad are standing in their way on the ramp, and they started backing up as the band made their way to the back.</p><p>Six Man Tag Team Match<br>Referee: Marty Rubalcaba<br>The Spirit Squad vs. The Highlanders and Rowdy Roddy Piper</p><p>The start:</p><p>Back on RAW and we are underway with Piper in control of Mikey.

Melina said that Mick Foley is boring because he talks about stuff from 12 years ago.

Edge got on the mic and insulted the crowd in attendance. Edge said Cena should go back to what made him popular in the first placeâ¦the throwback jerseys and more raps. Edge said he wrote a rap of his own to inspire Cena. Iâm not typing out his rap. Randy Orton then made his way to the ring as Edgeâs partner, and they will both be teaming with Intercontinental Champion Johnny Nitro who is still covered in paint, and looks pissed, as we go to commercial.
